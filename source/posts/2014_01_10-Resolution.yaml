  It's January, and that marks Year 3 of writing down my resolutions and measuring how
  I stood up to them. 

  Let's look at 
  [last year's resolutions](/post/2013_01_02-2013_Resolution_Roundup.html).

  - _1000 Pushups_ - Do 1000 non-consecutive pushups - **FAIL** - 
  I got to a surprising 300-or-so before my wrists started to give out. As it turns out, 
  combining programming and art and exercises that strain the wrists combine in an awkward
  way to make for sad times. I tried switching to knuckle-pushups, but urrrrgh. 
  - _Rhyme_ - Create a not-particularly-intelligent artificial intelligence. - **PASS**
  I built "By Graham", a bi-gram chatbot, and 
  ["Meep Moop", the world's dumbest robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnDtpg7bh0).
  - _Tempo-Tantrum_ - Become a permanent employee. - **FAIL** - 
  Nope, I'm still stuck in contract-employee town.  I aim to resolve this before March.
  - _Return to Cabin_ - Return to Travis' Cabin. Revel. - **PASS** - 
  This was an easy one. Went to the cabin twice. Had a great time twice. 
  - _Vacation, All I Ever Wanted_ - Leave the Country for Fun Times - **PASS** -
  I went to Florida to learn about Robots. Solid!
  - _Indie Street Cred_ - Work on an indie game with Dan. - **FAIL** - 
  This sort of fell through the cracks. Video game libraries are unimaginably awful to work
  with, as it would turn out. 
  - _Monthly Resolutions_ - New Resolutions Every Month. - **FAIL** - 
  This caused my mind to break down entirely by March. 

  So, out of 7 goals, that's **3** PASSes and **4** fails. Way to go, me. 

  Okay, extra credit time:

  ## 55 New Comics ##
  I wrote 55 Cube Drone comics, significantly upgrading my comic-production skills.

  [cube-drone.com](http://cube-drone.com) launched and got about 50,000 hits in 2013. 
  Most of that came from a comic
  that fell right out of the comic's target demographic into the laps of some gamers, 
  [this one about Armored Core](http://cube-drone.com/post/2013_05_16-Armored_Core.html). 

  Around about October I started getting distracted by .. that other thing I do, actually
  _building_ software, and Cube Drone started to taper off.
  On top of that, my Laptop died and took with it all of my working artisty configurations
  that now have to be resurrected. Next time: better backups. 
  Now it's January and I'm pretty much back to square one. 

  ## Pierc Contributors ##
  Remember last year when I turned pierc into a 
  [full on GitHub project](https://github.com/classam/pierc) with "documentation"
  and such? Well, it gathered some contributors and a teeny community! 

  ## SuperVanJS Talk ##
  I did [my first ever tech talk](/post/2014_01_06-Building_a_Development_Environment_Using_Vagrant__Chef.html),
  at SuperVanJS.

  I did okay in 2013, I guess!
  
  ## New Resolutions! ##
  
  I don't actually have a lot of resolutions for 2013. I have a lot of _projects_, but
  projects and resolutions are different things. Maybe I'll do more work on Cube Drone. 
  Maybe I'll finish one of my code projects. Maybe I'll finish a board game.
  I like to learn new things and try new things. 
  At the moment I'm just sort of content to let things be the way that they are. Things
  are pretty awesome. 

  - *Career. Seriously* - Figure out what's going to become of your career. Contracts are bad.
  - *Meepmoop 2.0* - Rebuild your robo-buddy. Teach him many things.
  - *Vacation* - Go on a cool vacation to somewhere.
 
  Okay, that's done.
