  <belam> classam|work: any more cube drone?
  <classam|work> belam: There's a new video out yesterday
  <belam> ah
  <belam> I require more cube drone
  <belam> would be nice if it's something on the predicament that I'm in. I'm in meeting hell.

  <classam|work> belam: Tell me more about your meeting hell
  <belam> Straddling projects - need to keep an eye on the old projects when coworker are trying to take over that work (babysitting required0w
  <belam> new project is really keen to have meetings
  <belam> I basically end up running around between the two.
  <belam> In the morning, I thought I had 2 conflicting meetings and attempted to dial into both
  <belam> (turns out I was wrong)
  <belam> new project is suffering from this:

  <classam|work> ^_^
  <belam> classam|work: tl;dr I'm going insane
  <classam|work> "going", yeah, sure :P
  <belam> hah
  <belam> think you've got enough on it?
  <classam|work> I'm not sure. It's tough to do stuff on meetings.
  <classam|work> I've written yards on meetings and it's hard to come up with stuff that's funny.
  <belam> nah, just being torn between 2 projects
  <classam|work> partially because the first ever appearance of Cube Drone was a huge long-form rant about meetings
  <classam|work> http://cube-drone.com/2011_01_08-Dont_Cry_Cube_Drone.html
  <classam|work> Torn between 2 projects is an interesting topic, but I need a joke around that
  <belam> Judgement of Solomon? :P
  <belam> I'm not a jokester :p
  <classam|work> I was thinking of going with a Natalie Imbruglia joke
  <belam> I like that
  <classam|work> I'M ALREADY TOOOOOORN 
  <classam|work> COLD AND I'M ASHAMED
  <belam> haha. 90s kids
  <classam|work> LYING NAKED ON THE FLOOR
  <classam|work> CONFUSION NEVER SOMETHING
  <classam|work> INTO SOMETHING REAL
  <classam|work> I'M A SOMETHING SOMETHING PERFECT SKY IS TORN
  <classam|work> it's funnier if Cube Drone doesn't know the song very well
  <belam> heh
  <classam|work> But fitting all of that into a three-panel strip that makes sense could be hard
  * classam|work thinks 
  <classam|work> Ooop, I've got it
  <classam|work> where's my note pad, I have to write this down
  <belam> Excellent
  <krichter|work> classam|work: how about... i'm working on this diet, and all my co-workers start bringing in candy due to the season
  <lumy> classam|work: Pumpkin Keg!
