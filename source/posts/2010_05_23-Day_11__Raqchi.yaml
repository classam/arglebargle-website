  had settled on our tents. \n\nIt was time for more driving, this time on roads a
  little bit more paved. \n\nWe stopped at the little town of Raqchi.  Most of the
  towns we've stopped in so far have been at least a little bit metropolitan - I mean,
  aside from dumpy ol' Chivay. Raqchi, however, was a little rural town built next
  to an Inca ruin.\n\nWe were led on a quick tour through the ruin.  It was apparently
  a vast food bank, selected thanks to the area's natual water reserves and optimal
  microclimate.\n\nWe passed a fountain that poured water constantly, despite the
  fact that nobody knows exactly where the water comes from.  Apparently the Inca
  were deft hydrological engineers.\n\nAfter the ruins, we met our homestay families
  and walked to our individual farms.  Me, Kristen, Lars (the Hollander) and Brendan
  (the Aussie) settled in and were served a delicious lunch of 'miscellaneous vegetables
  in soup' and 'rice, pork, and potatoes'.\n\nThe family had three daughters, several
  chickens, a duck or two, a puppy, a dog, and a cat.\n\nWe loafed around a bit, then
  followed the family back into town for a pottery demonstration.  We were allowed
  to watch them make pottery, so long as we bought some afterwards. It was a painstaking
  process, but one of the homestay women turned out a perfect little pot.  One of
  the tour group members tried, and proudly turned out a sad, lumpy little pot.\n\nWe
  trudged back to the homestay's farm.  Long walks at high altitude are painful.\n\nWe
  took this opportunity to share a few gifts with our homestay.  A Vancouver picture
  book, with words in Spanish. Some soaps.  Canadian change.  They seemed happy with
  the gifts, looking at the Vancouver cityscape and going 'whooaaaah, wow!' and the
  younger daughters fighting a little bit over the coins. (Brendan gave the two of
  them little stuffed Koallas, and the older daughter got a bigger one.  You had better
  bet that created a bit of sibling unpleasantness.) \n\nIt was about here that my
  headache grew from 'persistent and irritating' to 'nigh incapacitating'.  I couldn't
  eat dinner, or celebrate Pachamama with the rest of the revelers.  I don't even
  really know what Pachamama is, but I'm sure I missed it.  Whatever it was, it involved
  dressing us all up in traditional Peruvian clothes and dancing in the city square?
  \ Kristen looked hilarious.  I just sat in my bed, clutching at my head in agony
  until I fell asleep.\n\nThe thick wool blankets were really nice, though."
