  NOOOOOOO\" />\n\nSo, one of my hard drives died. It was the drive I keep all of
  my comics on. Good thing I keep reliable backups, eh, eh? \n\nIt was also the drive
  that my incoming torrents get pushed into. There was months and months of new stuff
  in there! Stuff that I hadn't categorized, yet! Stuff that I hadn't watched yet!
  Ghost in the Shell! Boardwalk Empire! Old stuff that I liked to re-watch, like Archer
  and How I Met Your Mother! All gone! GONE I TELLS YOU! \n\nOh, and also, my Adobe
  directory. So I had to make this comic on my stupid comparatively-slow MacBook laptop.
  \ Gonna have to fix that, soon. Real soon. \n"
