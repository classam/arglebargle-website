  had slept for a good 12 hours and we only had a few more hours to walk, all downhill.\n\nI
  had done the previous day's 8-hour hike in 8 hours and 20 minutes or so - not bad,
  even if the friendly guide helped out by throwing my day-pack on a horse.  The 'fast'
  group had once again made excellent time.\n\nThe walk downhill was easy and fast.
  \ I stuck with the 'fast' group the whole time - it was an easy trek, and at 4100
  meters, the air was breathable again.  I had lightened my day pack- today it was
  just water and a camera, nothing else, so I was lighter on my feet. \n\nWe flew
  down the mountain, and this time, I took ample pictures.\n\nWhen we hit the bottom,
  a bus was waiting for us, and we drove - towards Ollantaytambo, where Kristen was
  staying.  Kristen... and flush toilets! And hot showers!  No more 'pit dug in the
  ground' for me!\n\nWe stopped on the way for \"Chicha\", a fermented corn beer popular
  with the locals - if anything because, thanks to the simple recipe and vast amount
  of corn produced by Peru, it is dirt cheap.  A full litre of the stuff in a great
  giant glass was 3 soles for the natives and 5 soles for the tourists.  I had a teeny
  tiny glass, as my stomach was still recovering.  I also tried a tiny glass of \"Frutillada\",
  chicha with strawberries and toasted cinnamon added.  It was nice, but I couldn't
  stomach too much more.  Our guides downed a few huge glasses of the stuff, and we
  played a ring-toss like game where we threw tokens at a hand-crafted cabinet. \n\nI
  managed to get a token in the frog's mouth, the hardest shot. Take THAT, Peru. (When
  you see the pictures this will make a lot more sense.)\n\nThen, the bus to Ollantaytambo,
  and Kristen!  We met up at the little hostel that we would be staying at, and I
  finally had a shower. Joy!  I didn't have shampoo, the water pressure was low, and
  the only clean pants I had left were swim trunks, so it was not the best shower,
  but it was still a darn good shower.\n\nKristen was fine - a bit smug that while
  I was busting my butt climbing a mountain, she had been relaxing in Ollantaytambo,
  and the trek was her idea in the first place.  She also thought that my miscommunication,
  and the horse named \"Lares\", was hilarious.\n\nA little bit later, we explored
  the ruins of Ollantaytambo - another Inca city built on a hill, this time a much
  larger one. Many, many steps up.  Kristen had a little trouble on the steps.  I
  had just climbed a mountain. FEAR ME, TINY STEPS.  Perhaps my head had grown a little
  big, because at the top I was huffing and puffing, too. \n\nMe and Kristen had lunch
  - my hunger was starting to come back, I ate a whole sandwich! We spent the rest
  of the night at the hotel, loafing about.  I surfed the internet a bit - instructions
  for convocation came in the mail. In order to participate in the ceremony, I had
  to reserve some 'regalia' - robe and mortarboard - online, with a deadline that
  ended before I came back from Peru, so I cleared that up. \n\nTomorrow? Machu Picchu.
  \n\n\n"
