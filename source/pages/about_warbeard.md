Warbeard the Mighty
===================
The *operations guy*. A tightly-wound ball of stress and invective, 
he keeps all of the servers running. He plays an obscene amount of 
D&D, and he has a beard. Thus the name. 

Warbeard [does not like new technology](http://cube-drone.com/2014_10_18-90_The_Ancient_Ways.html), 
and he especially [doesn't like developers mucking around with his pristine deployment environments](http://cube-drone.com/2013_06_26-Cube_Drone_50_Reproachful_Powerpoint.html).
He does his level best to keep everything
that the team throws at him up and running, but it's a hard job, 
and he's the only ops guy on the team. Seriously, they could at 
least hire someone to give him a break
from pager duty now and then, right? 

Warbeard has many opinions about board games. He will share them with
you if you are not careful.
