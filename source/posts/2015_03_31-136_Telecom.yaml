  Cube Drone: Are those... telecom people?
  | Cube Drone backs away slowly. Cube Drone: oh shit oh shit oh shit
  | Two men with polygonal heads walk by, one, with a pyramid head, 
    wearing a blazer and red shirt, the other, with an extruded octagonal head,
    wearing a polo shirt with an ID tag.
