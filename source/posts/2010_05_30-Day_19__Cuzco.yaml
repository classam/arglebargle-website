  \ We're meeting up with Dragoman again tomorrow. Went back to the English pub, this
  time to have Fish and Chips and a Chicken and Bacon Pie for lunch, both of which
  were surprisingly good. Kristen's feeling sick, showing a lot of altitude sickness
  symptoms - I'm guessing because while I was gallivanting around the mountains, she
  was way down at Ollantaytambo, a much lower altitude.  \n\nI've spent a big chunk
  of the day writing blog entries, Kristen's been playing games on her Nintendo DS.
  \ Now I'm going to go out and get some food for the both of us - if I can learn
  how to say 'to go' in Spanish, maybe that Chinese place down the road will work
  out. \n\nTomorrow, we're driving to Puno.  After that, it's Lake Titicaca and Copacabana
  for two days, and then La Paz, which is where our tour ends.  I'll be home in a
  week.  "
