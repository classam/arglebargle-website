  title=\"Voula's Offshore Cafe\">Voula's Offshore Cafe</a> changed the way I think
  about hashbrowns.  Their shredded hashbrowns were crispy on the outside and soft
  on the inside. </li> \n<li> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/piroshky-piroshky-seattle\">Piroshky
  Piroshky</a> was delicious as always. </li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/pike-place-chowder-seattle\">Pike
  Place Chowder</a> was delicious. I went twice, tried two different chowders, and
  had the dungeness crab roll and Po' Boy. Om nom nom. </li>\n<li> The Rock Bottom
  Restaurant and Brewery was... a capable but unspectacular pub. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>
  What did you play? </h4>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/90305/cargo-noir\">Cargo
  Noir</a> was okay, but a little sluggish. Auction games are very competitive and
  make me feel a little uneasy. </li> \n<li> I could see why <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27833/steam\">Steam</a>
  had such a high BoardGameGeek ranking - richly strategic, it played like a cross
  between Puerto Rico and Ticket To Ride - but it had a _lot_ of moving parts and
  dragged at times. I can see playing it again in the future, but I'm unlikely to
  purchase a copy. </li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/859/illuminati\">Illuminati</a>
  had all of the traditional balance and pacing issues of a Steve Jackson card game
  - but hey, still fun. </li> \n<li> <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit\">Dixit</a>
  rocked as always. Also, Sean revealed that I had been describing the rules <em>just
  slightly wrong</em> all along.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66356/dungeons-dragons-wrath-of-ashardalon-board-game\">Wrath
  of Ashardalon </a> was a little co-operative DM-less D&D 4th edition adventure in
  a box - and it was a giant, pulsating barrel of fun. The D&D rules fit into a board
  game well, and the well chosen pieces and monster tokens added a lot to the game.
  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Did you do anything else?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Drinking in a hotel
  room! </li> \n<li> Attending Grace's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzYxLlO55ew&feature=player_embedded\">Fat-Ugly-Or-Slutty</a>
  panel! </li> \n<li> Attending most of a dungeon master Q&A panel! </li> \n<li> Watching
  the Video Game Orchestra! </li>\n<li> Beating random strangers at Mario Kart DS
  and Team Fortress 2! </li>\n<li> Sitting in a bean bag chair! </li>\n<li> Wandering
  the crowded and oft-stinky expo hall! </li> \n<li> Drinking drip coffee at 11:00
  at night! </li> \n<li> Seriously and with all of my heart wishing Kristen was there
  with me! </li>\n<li> Wandering in Pike Place Market! </li> \n</ul> \n\n<h4> Verdict?
  </h4>\n\nI'll see you next year, PAX.  "
