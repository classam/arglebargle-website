  Red-Haired Woman: So, based on your appearance, I assume you're looking for some sort of... dank pit, or dungeon? 
  | (Milo, Cube-Drone, and Walt look unimpressed) Walt: I'm not sure if that's really the image we're looking for. 
  | Red-Haired Woman: But, like, *really* fast internet, right? 
  | Walt: Oh definitely.
