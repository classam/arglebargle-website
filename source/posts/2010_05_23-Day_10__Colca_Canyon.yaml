content: ! "This day was a drive day.\n\nI felt tired and terrible, but Kristen felt
  worse.  I ended up missing my morning shower, lugging all of the bags around, and
  missing breakfast so that I could get Kristen some oxygen and a sit-down.  It doesn't
  sound like I missed much, though.  In case you're worrying, Kristen felt better
  about halfway through the day.   \n\nWe drove to Colca Canyon, one of the deepest
  canyons in the world.  There were no condors. \n\nWe drove a little further, and
  arrived at a dumpy, crappy little town.  \"Wow, this is even worse than Chivay\",
  I thought. \"Oh, wait, that shop looks familiar.\" - yes, we had returned to Chivay,
  the Colca Canyon being a side-trip. We then continued on our long drive.\n\nOur
  tour guides called the road we travelled the 'worst road in South America', and
  while I imagine that they were exaggerating a bit, the road was definitely no fun.
  \ It was a dirt road, with pits and dips and holes.  The road was about big enough
  for a car and a half, and we spent quite a bit of our time climbing up the side
  of mountains on these narrow roads. \n\nI'm a bit panicky around heights - driving
  on bumpy, terrible roads on the side of mountain ranges, that's a recipe for pants-shitting
  terror.  I spent the bulk of my time carefully reading my book and trying my utmost
  not to look out the windows - which, especially during dips in the road, promised
  spectacular views of the vast, vast distances between us and the ground. \n\nBut
  instead of leading to an even-more terrifying descent, these roads just led up,
  and up, and up.  And up in the mountains?  Fields, hills, towns. The roads were
  well-traveled by livestock - alpaca, llama, sheep, and cattle.\n\nWe stopped at
  a campsite in the mountains.  We set up our tents and tried again to sleep.\n\nOnce
  again, I didn't sleep well.  It was cold, and my mock-pillow of wadded shirts was
  hard and unpleasant.  My headache remained.\n"
