  This year, I'm doing month-resolutions.
  Have to check in on those goals every month!

  ### How'd You Do? ###

  - *1000 Pushups* - I'm up to 60. Gotta pick up the pace!
  - *Rhyme* - I've managed to make an evolutionary algorithm that
    adds 2 numbers together inaccurately, some of the time. Hum. 
  - *Return To Cabin* - The date's booked. Just have to let the bossman
    know about my vacation hours. 
  - *Indie Street Cred* - Tiny mans are moving on a little grid. 
  
  So, for January, I had "We'll All Drone On" and "Drone Drone" - 
  draw a new Cube Drone comic and launch a new Cube Drone video.
  I actually got 4 comics done, 
  [one](http://cube-drone.com/post/2013_01_04-Cube_Drone_13_Hello_Sysadmin.html),
  [two](http://cube-drone.com/post/2013_01_07-Cube_Drone_14_Warbeard_The_Frothy.html),
  [three](http://cube-drone.com/post/2013_01_18-Cube_Drone_15_Tools.html),
  [four](http://cube-drone.com/post/2013_01_25-Cube_Drone_16_Forever_Project.html),
  and I finished a [Cube Drone short](http://cube-drone.com/post/2013_02_02-Cube_Drone__Source_Control.html), 
  although it stretched a day into February. I'll let that slide.

  While I was at it, I built a website for just my comics - 
  [cube-drone.com](http://cube-drone.com/index.html). It uses the same
  engine and blog repository as the rest of my blog, so I only ever 
  have to post in one place - if I include the "Cube Drone" tag in a blog
  item, it'll automatically cross-post it to cube-drone.com. Nice. 
  
  So, I successfully passed both resolutions! Which means I have to pick
  harder ones for next month. 
  
  ### Anything Else? ###
  I learned how to use [meteor.js](http://meteor.com/) by building an 
  implementation of the
  [autofocus productivity system](http://ottofocus.meteor.com/) in a day,
  and launching it as an app. It's on [github](https://github.com/classam/ottofocus).
  And it all fits into about 600 lines of code.

  The funny thing is, I despise gimmicky productivity systems. Probably 
  won't ever use it. Just wanted to build it. 
  
  I learned how to use [Bootstrap CSS](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/),
  on both ottofocus.meteor.com and cube-drone.com. 
  I like that it makes a minimalist, usable website right 
  out-of-the-box with very, very little added CSS.  My only problem with
  Bootstrap is that ; from now on, every single side-project I do is going
  to look very, very samey - because, once I have something running, I
  usually have trouble finding the motivation to try to make it pretty. 

  ### February ###
  
  Febresolutions! 

  - *Fake It* - Post a new comic every Monday and Wednesday. 
  - *Plan A* - Plan a short vacation. 
  - *Tasty Pie* - Learn django's REST libraries. 
  - *Pack the Hlanet* - Build another ridiculous little thing. 
  - *Short* - Write a short story. Show nobody.
