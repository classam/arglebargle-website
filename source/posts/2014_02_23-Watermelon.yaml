  curtis.lassam.net is now rocking a brand new [busbus](https://github.com/classam/busbus) 
  theme.

  _Wait, what is Busbus?_

  Oh, I think I might have mentioned it like a year ago. At some point in 
  the past I decided that I had had enough of Wordpress and built a 
  blog engine as a Ruby project. It's, I think, one of the first things I'd ever built in
  Ruby. It works as a compiler, taking a 
  [directory full of YAML files](https://github.com/classam/Blog)
  and rendering them into a website.  Different YAML files can have different
  content types, so I can write blog posts in markdown, include comics as
  simple image links, and paste IRC conversations in directly from IRC. 

  Busbus, all of the blog's YAML files, and the Busbus themes for this site, 
  as well as http://cube-drone.com , all live on github.  Pushing any files
  to GitHub triggers the recompilation of the live site. 

  It's completely undocumented, and complicated as heck. I wouldn't recommend
  it for anybody but me. I'm not sure if I'd even recommend it for me - but
  I certainly like how simple it is for me to manage the site using only
  vim and bash and git. Isn't it just like a programmer to make everything
  in such a way that only a programmer could enjoy it? 

  Anyhow, [here's a link to the front-page of the old theme](http://curtis.lassam.net/2014_copy/), 
  just for comparison's sake. I'll miss you, silly flipping!

  The new theme's source is [here](https://github.com/classam/busbus_theme/tree/bootstrap3).

  ## Features ##
  
  * The site now properly supports Category filtering. If you click on one of
    the category buttons, like "Comic", it will filter any non-"Comic" blog
    posts out of the page. 
  * The site's color scheme is now delightfully watermelon-flavored. 
  * Important navigational elements are arrayed along the top of the page. 
    This is important because some of the site's content - namely, comics 
    - are 900+ pixels wide. 
  * [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) providing the core grid
    system, rather than a grid system of my own devising. It does a better 
    job of laying things out responsively. 
  * [Fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons! Google Fonts fonts!
  * The blog's index page loads the content of the past several weeks, giving
    more of a convenient entry point into the blog's content. 

  ## Antifeatures ##

  * There's no silly flipping. I'll miss you, silly flipping. 
  * I think the design is more usable but less visually compelling. 

  ## And now for a story about Ruby ##
  
  "What version of Ruby should I install on my computer to test the new theme?"

  Well, 1.9.2 seems like the obvious choice. Word on the street is that not
  all of the Windows libraries are up-to-date for Ruby 2.1, although this is 
  more hearsay than reasonable thought. Anyways, this system was built with a 
  Ruby 1.X, I don't want to spend all day dealing with version compatibility 
  issues.

  Oh, 1.9.2 doesn't work. When I run Busbus, it throws an error having to do
  with the consumption of my YAML files. 

  Between 1.9.2 and 1.8.7, Ruby changed its core YAML processing engine to
  one that can't handle non-utf-8 encoded inputs. Glorious. I never even knew
  that ISO latin-1 or ASCII wasn't supposed to be valid for YAML files. 
  Now I know. There's a lot of YAML files in my blog folder, though. 
  I certainly on't feel like converting them all. 

  I should get things running with a modern Ruby, though, right? 
  In order to get everything running in 1.9.2, we make judicious 
  use of the 'encode' function to get everything converted properly to utf-8
  before we try to read it. The '?' character proliferates.   

  And then we deploy the system... and it fails. Because 'encode' as a function
  was included in Ruby 1.9.2, but the target Dreamhost server is running 1.8.7 
  because upgrades are expensive and hard, apparently. 

  So the YAML code isn't forwards OR backwards compatible between 1.9.2 and 
  1.8.7. Glee. Okay, now there are two different branches of the code, one
  for each of the Ruby versions. I am not sure if I am okay with this. 
  
  Ah, well, at the end of the day, it worked, right?
