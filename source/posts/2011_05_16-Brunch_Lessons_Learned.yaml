content: ! "This weekend, I attempted to make Eggs Benedict for 8 persons simultaneously.
  \ Here are some of the challenges faced:\n\n<ul>\n<li> I only have 6 undamaged plates.
  \ <small>Solution: Give the chipped plate to Dan, he won't notice. Give the extremely-chipped
  plate to Curtis - he won't complain. </small></li> \n<li> I only have 7 chairs.
  <small>Solution: Curtis eats on the couch and considers purchasing another folding
  chair. </small> </li> \n<li> I have never poached so many eggs for so many people.
  <small> Solution: Learn how. </small> </li>\n<li> I have never <del>successfully</del>
  made hollandaise from scratch. <small> Solution: Try again. Have prepackaged hollandaise
  as a backup. </small> </li> \n</ul>\n\nI started cooking at 9AM, and we weren't
  all eating until 12:15-12:30 - by which point, I was so hungry I was about to pass
  out over my terrible, terrible hollandaise. \n\nSome lessons learned: \n\n<ul>\n<li><a
  href=\"http://www.google.ca/#hl=en&xhr=t&q=ruined+hollandaise&cp=0&pq=hollandaise&pf=p&sclient=psy&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=ruined+hollandaise&pbx=1&fp=814bc38e6cd125da\">Actual
  Real Hollandaise</a> is a trap, and very, very difficult to make. I don't care,
  I'm going to get it yet.</li>\n<li>Packaged hollandaise is super-easy to make and
  also mega-tasty. <small>I had some, just in case the real hollandaise failed, and
  I was glad that I did. </small>  </li>\n<li>English muffins, if left unattended
  in an oven, <small>perhaps while waiting for a second hollandaise to take shape,
  </small> will become inedible pucks. </li>\n<li> It is possible to pre-poach 18
  eggs, then reheat them on command. Poach once, put in a mesh strainer in an ice-bath,
  store in the fridge, then drop the mesh strainer into boiling water just before
  service. <small> Warning: water everywhere. </small> </li> \n<li> Cooking 1 kilogram
  of hashbrowns, even in an extra-large frying pan, takes around 40 minutes, just
  because there's such a lot of them and so little cooking space. Next time, bust
  out the electric griddle. </li> \n<li> 1 kilogram of hashbrowns is insufficient
  for 8 people.  Estimate 1 kilogram of hashbrowns for 4-6 people.  Next time, cook
  a full 2-kilo for 8 people, or prepare another side-dish. </li> \n<li> When people
  help with dishes, you get all of the fun parts (cooking) without any of the irritating
  parts (cleaning). </li>\n<li> Look, I really appreciate that you brought such a
  clever and original treat to the party, but GIDDAFUCK OUT MAH KITCHEN. </li>\n</ul>\n\nAnd
  now, to make up for the sheer boringocity of this post, I present to you: A moustached
  man, riding a crocodile, with a pipe.\n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/comics/hello_ladies.png\"
