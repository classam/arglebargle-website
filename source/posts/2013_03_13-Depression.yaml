  I've had a tumultuous March.
  
  I don't usually go on about personal philosophy, because I don't 
  want to cultivate the impression that I think I'm particularly 
  _deep_ or _intelligent_. I am neither of those things.

  I am an atheist. I really don't want the topic here to be 'atheism' - 
  that's not what this blog post is about - but it's important for 
  the rest of the article, so bear with me for a little bit. 

  When I was in my teens, I wanted to share my philosophy far and wide. 
  Clearly, _atheism is right_ and _religion is wrong_ and why won't you
  just _listen to me_. As I grew (and I'm only 26, so I'm sure that there's
  a lot more room for change), I lost a lot of the antagonistic edge that I'd
  developed. Most of the Christians I've met have been pleasant, kind, charitable
  and happy people, people involved in organized religious groups tend to
  live longer, and -best of all- belief in an afterlife protects them from
  *The Crushing Fear That Comes With Atheism*. 

  *The Fear* is the worst thing I've experienced. It's always there with me. 
  It's a yawning abyss of terror. When Arkham investigators glimpse the 
  truth of the many-angled ones and 
  [go mad from the revelation](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation), 
  *The Fear* is what they experience. 
  
  It doesn't matter _what_ you experience. It doesn't matter how happy you are
  right now. Nothing matters, because you will die. Having transitioned
  to a state where you no longer exist, to a non-observational state, 
  everything ceases to have meaning. So why do anything?

  Eventually, the universe will come to some sort of crashing halt, and
  humanity will cease to ever exist, and everything we've ever done will
  have come to naught. 
  
  Some people are legacy-builders. They live in order to try to make a 
  positive mark on humanity. Even _if_ their legacy outlasts them, though, 
  once their ticket is punched, it ceases to matter. And, failing a few
  extremely lucky (or particularly evil) humans, a legacy can only go so far.

  Some people are hedonists. They live in order to enjoy living. Living is
  _fun_. There are so many wonderful, pleasurable experiences to have. Sex
  and porcetta, social interaction and complex video games, sunsets and great
  novels - and with so many people all creating content at the same time, it
  feels like we've almost reached a critical mass of media - we're
  producing interesting experiences faster than it's even possible to consume
  them. 
 
  But still, eventually, death. For legacy-builders and hedonists alike, 
  death still spells an ultimate end to the tale. All of the constructive
  influence, all of the fun, it all must come to an end.  

  I don't know about you, but this awful revelation fills me with a cycle of
  panic (as I am forced to confront this), grief (as I try to cope with this), 
  despair (as I fail to), and then frantic, deluded optimism (as I construct 
  an elaborate set of plausible lies that might allow me to function once more).
  Then, it all repeats when something knocks a hole in my delusion.

  And it gets worse. The last time it hit, I just lied on my couch and cried
  for a couple of days, unable to move, go to work, or function as an adult. 
  Too depressed to do anything. Too overcome with anxiety to be able to 
  decide on anything worth doing. 
  If you're wondering, my March resolutions were a lot less exciting than
  my January or February ones. "Go to Work" and "Experience some kind of happiness". 
  I tossed in "stop drinking coffee" once I realized that caffeine probably 
  doesn't help my staggering levels of general-purpose anxiety any. 

  I'm not sure if it's possible to function without _some_ kind of delusion.
  "I have a long time", or "if I live a healthy lifestyle, I can have more time", 
  or "nobody knows what happens after we die, maybe there's _something_ that
  happens to our consciousness". 

  That's the beauty of Christianity. It's a delusion that won't leave you in 
  the lurch - it's internally consistent and resistant to outside interference
  to the point where a devotee could happily believe it without fault 
  perpetually. 

  My delusion is not so stable, but I'd like to share it with you, anyways.

  Maybe we can beat it.  Maybe we can _win_. We can _manufacture an afterlife_.
  Immortality has been a pipe dream for all of human history, but so was 
  flight and fusion, and we managed to lick both of those in the past 
  century (given, "uncontrolled fusion" and "only briefly controlled fusion", 
  but, hey, progress).

  We don't have to face the ultimate end if we can conquer it. We can survive
  the smallest death, the human death, with science that's only a generation
  or two advanced from where we are today. We're so _close_.
  
  We can survive the death of our planet, the death of our sun, if we learn to
  travel through space, to find new homes in the stars. This will take us much
  longer, but with our elongated lifespans, hey, why not? 

  We might even be able to survive the heat death of our universe.
  The physicists don't know if that's possible, yet.  

  We're getting closer and closer to the point where we can grow 
  [replacement human organs from scratch](http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2012/08/ghost_heart_a_framework_for_gr.html).
  There's a lot of surprisingly valuable stuff in the intersection 
  between 3D printing and stem cells that is making regenerative medicine 
  a real thing. 

  Implantable electrodes and neuroplasticity have created the fields of 
  neuroprosthetics and BCI - interfaces directly to the brain. Which helps, 
  because it means there's a whole lot less of ourselves that we really
  need to be able to save. Just keep the brain in good condition - we can
  worry about the other bits later. 

  We're making progress on dementia and Alzheimers'. We can keep the brain 
  healthy for longer. We might even be able to keep the brain healthy in a
  oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid, separating it from any of the
  bits that we can't figure out how to save. 
  
  I'm of the opinion that 'upload, then die' is still a death. It's _me_
  that I want to save, not some carbon (silicon?) copy of me - although I 
  would accept upload in the absence of better options.  
  I think, though - if, through implantable interfaces, I start to think 
  'outside the box' - and I mean literally - if my consciousness expands 
  to include a lot of machine interfaces and a few extremely limited 
  biological remnants from the past - then 
  gradually losing that last little bit of biological dead weight doesn't
  seem quite so bad. The "[Lincoln's Axe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)"
  survival strategy could work - although the thought of turning
  my consciousness over to system administrators and Hewlett Packard 
  is actually even _more_ panic inducing.
  
  Sure, dramatically increased lifespans introduce a whole bunch of new
  social and economic problems. That's okay. We have time to fix them.
  The internet introduced a lot of new social and economic problems, too. 
  
  [It's going to be the future, soon.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZEEDa9Mej8) 

  But the sooner, the better, because there are a lot of people I'd like to
  save.  I mean, I'm putting myself at the very top of that list, on account
  of being massively self-absorbed, but, hey, after me, my family, and my friends,
  it wouldn't hurt to, you know, try to keep everybody else.

  So, my delusion is _boundless technological optimism_. 

  And the thing that pushes me back into depression? Well, anything that 
  reminds me exactly how delusional my optimism is. 

  [We're ruining the planet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/reo35/the_discussion_of_climate_change_is_so_poisoned/c45ciej)
  We don't have climate models advanced enough to show exactly how things
  will play out, and yet every scientist in play is pointing out that 
  there are many, many ways that we could accidentally kill everybody on 
  earth by fucking with things too much. 

  I have a vested interest in not killing _every single person_, on account
  of being _one of those people_. Heck, I'm not even a fan of killing 
  'most people', on account of not particularly liking those odds. 

  Our response? [Firing environmental scientists.](http://elizabethmay.ca/in-the-news/island-tides/killing-environmental-science/).
  Metaphorically solving the problem of a house-fire by taking the batteries out
  of the smoke detector and hoping for the best. 

  If we happen not to destroy the Earth - it's possible, if unlikely - our
  current ridiculous level of scientific and technological prosperity is
  propped up by oil, coal, helium, and rare earth metals
  that exist in increasingly limited supply. It can only last so long.
  Sure, we _might_ transition to clean, renewable, sustainable technologies.
  But it seems just as likely that that transition will occur pretty shakily
  throughout the greatest economic collapse ever seen, and it will take 
  generations for things to recover - if at all.  

  Even if we're fortunate enough to conquer most causes of death, there's 
  still accidents, murderers, wars, diseases... 
  
  Sometimes, I don't have enough optimism to keep it together.

  Maybe we'll make it. Maybe we won't. Maybe I'll be there to see it all.
  Probably I won't. 

  But I can hope. And I'll do everything I can to help. As long as I can.
