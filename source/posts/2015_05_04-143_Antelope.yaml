  Walt is looking at his phone.
  Cube Drone: Hey, Walt - why did we take a telecom contract?
  | Walt: When a lioness chases a herd of antelopes, she doesn't
  chase the strong ones - she chases the slow, weak, old ones
  who are no longer useful to the pack.
  | Cube Drone: So we're the lionesses?
  Walt: What? I was just watching Animal Planet on my phone.
