  loaded up the bus, and were off, on a long, long drive to Arequipa.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4680515300/\"

  lot to talk about on Day 7.  Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, stop and
  have some sandwiches for lunch, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, arrive
  in Arequipa just as it's getting dark.  Get to Hotel.\n\nWe were promised warm showers
  (finally) but the water was shut off when we arrived.  Instead, we unpacked a bit
  and headed out to a nice restaurant for dinner.  I had the \"Triple Tradicion\",
  three traditional Arequipan meals on the same plate.  There was a deep-fried pork
  rib, which was delicious, a pork-chili-stuffed-pepper, which was delicious, and
  some sort of pile of salsa and tripe, which was disgusting and slimy.  Well, two
  out of three ain't bad. \n\nKristen had a pasta with oil, tomato, and garlic - simple,
  but delicious, and very well done, with lots of garlic. \n\nI was sitting next to
  Dave, who allowed me to try a little bit of his Alpaca Osso Buco.  Alpaca is very
  similar to lamb, and reacts just as well to being slow-braised in wine and served
  with polenta. \n\nPerhaps it was the long drive.  Perhaps it was the rich meal after
  a few days of small meals.  Perhaps it was the sudden elevation - Arequipa is 7800
  feet above sea level.  We all staggered back to our hotel rooms and almost immediately
  fell asleep. "
