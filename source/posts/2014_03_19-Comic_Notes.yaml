  I've been short of funny ideas for Cube Drone comics for a while.
  I found a sketchpad full of ideas that I couldn't coalesce into 
  funny comics. Here they are:

  * PHP is awful.
  * nobody uses Haskell or O'Caml.
  * Ruby is Python.
  * Javascript changes every 15 minutes.
  * Python is Ruby.
  * C++ is inscrutable.
  * C is invincible.
  * Lisp is not the language you want to program in.
  * Lisp is a tool for building the language you want to program in.
  * Modals are irritating.
  * Heartburn is terrible. 
  * Users are morons.
  * Wine is delicious. 
  * We are behind schedule. 
  * I have a great idea for a new feature. 
  * Twitter is a waste of time. 
  * Deployment is stressful.
  * The intern makes rookie mistakes. 
  * The seasoned professional still makes rookie mistakes. 
  * Meetings kill your code boner.
