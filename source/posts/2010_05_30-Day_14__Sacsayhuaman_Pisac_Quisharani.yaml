content: ! "On Day 14, we moved from the Dragoman tour operator to the more specialized
  Andina Travel tour operator, for the Andean Community Trek. \n\nThe \"Andean Community
  Trek\" is an alternate trek to the classic Inca trail.  It happens in roughly the
  same area, but it's more remote, it goes even higher, and there are very few tourists
  on it.  The difference in expense between the two trails goes to support local villages.\n\nThe
  first day of the trek was not really about trekking- it was more about exploring
  various ruins around the town. \n\nFirst, Sacsayhuaman Fortress, a big stone dealy.
  \ We walked around it. And up it. Then back down.  There was a point from where
  we could see the entire city of Cuzco. There was a place where we could walk through
  a pitch-black tunnel and come out the other side.  Apparently, the Inca Empire was
  riddled with handy-but-labyrinthine little tunnels for various purposes.\n\nAfter
  Sacsayhuaman, we bussed to Pisac for lunch. The lunch included a soup and a main
  meal - both of which were delicious. Me and Kristen also both had limonadas.  I'm
  going to digress for a little bit to talk about limonadas, because they're important.\n\nA
  limonada, or 'lemonade' (yuh) is very different in Peru.  It's offered in <del>nearly</del>
  every restaurant, and it's generally very refreshing - certainly one of my most
  common beverage orders, even though I'd prefer an American style lemonade. \n\nPeruvian
  lemons are different, though.  It's hard for me to describe, so here's an excerpt
  from an <a title='Peruvian Food Blogger on Lemons' href=\"http://limadelhi.blogspot.com/2006/05/taste-for-lemon.html\">appropriate
  blog post on the topic</a>: \n\n<blockquote> \nMost of you might be familiar with
  the American lemon. You know the type. They are yellow and big, around the size
  of a tennis ball, and have a sweet-sour flavor.\n\n<img src='http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4395/1178/320/limon.jpg'
  />\nPeruvian lemon is a bit different. For starters, its appearance. Our lemons
  are deep green and about the size of a golf ball. These lemons are extremely sour
  and they are the key element in national dishes such as the world famous ceviche.
  Sufficed to say, you would never be able to make ceviche with American lemons, you'd
  just be missing out on the whole thing. This is the reason why every tourist who
  comes hear is marveled by the dish. You won't find it anywhere else in the world.
  Not ours. And the reason is very simple: only Peruvian lemon is strong enough to
  cook the raw fish ceviche is made with.\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, Peruvian lemonade
  is very different.  It tends to be a bit frothy, a bit sour, and quite refreshing.
  \ Even better, when one can find it, is the Limonada Helados (\"Ice Lemonade\")
  which is the lemonade blended with ice to make a drink that approaches <em>maximum
  refreshment</em>.\n\nPisac had a large market, and roaming around the market after
  lunch, I finally found what I was looking for: Boring blankets.  Every corner of
  Peru is lined with tourist shacks selling thin, brightly coloured blankets emblazoned
  with Inca symbology, but that's not what I wanted - I wanted a sensible, boring
  looking wool blanket that I could drape over a couch or a bed. I found one in brown
  plaid, which was perfect.\n\nThe Pisac ruins were a small Inca town, made out of
  huge rocks, very high.  Alarmingly so.  This was also the first time that I was
  able to see the famous Inca terraces, turning entire mountain faces into useful,
  arable land.  In order to protect the terraces for tourists and archaeologists,
  nothing is growing on them, which is raising protests from farmers, who estimate
  that the additional food grown on the terraces could comfortably support most of
  Peru's poor. \n\nWalking around Sacsayhuaman and Pisac counted as our hour of walking
  for the day.  Hard, thanks to myriad stairs and hills, but certainly nothing to
  complain about.\n\nWe bussed to the tiny community of Quisharani, the starting location
  for our trek.  The porters had already set up our tents, and included inside soft
  little sleeping mats.  With Dragoman, we had to set up our own tents, and use our
  own mats (which were warm, light, and convenient, but rock hard), so this was a
  nice change.\n\nOur 'kitchen team' provided a surprisingly large dinner.  Soup,
  rice, and meat.  It was very good, and we soon after went to bed.  Tomorrow, the
  real trek would begin."
