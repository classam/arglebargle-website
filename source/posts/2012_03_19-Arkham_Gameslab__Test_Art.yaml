content: ! "So, <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=1820\">Wasteland</a> is
  getting... more and more done. \n\nIt's not perfect, but it's at the point of fiddly
  balance rather than game-changing, I think. \n\nSo now I'm starting to screw around
  with potential art for <a href=\"https://github.com/classam/arkham_gameslab/blob/master/wasteland/crisis_deck.yaml\"
  title=\"Crisis Cards\">the cards</a>.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/comics/wasteland/mustard-gas-company.gif\"
  alt=\"Card - Mustard Gas Company\" />\n\n<img src=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/comics/wasteland/radangel.gif\"
  alt=\"Card - Radiation Angel\" />\n\n... so, it's pretty ugly.  And these two drawings
  took a solid 4 hours. Maybe I'll go typography-heavy on the cards and save the art
  for the manual. Or no art. NOTHING BUT WORDS AND COLORS. yeah. "
