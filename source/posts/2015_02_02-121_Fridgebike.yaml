  C would be a motorcycle. Popular with tinkerers and performance enthusiasts - who will tell you
  that it is only dangerous if you don't take the proper safety precautions, often while nursing
  a fresh injury.
  | PHP was your first car. It was really easy to get started with, and it was a great way to
  get around. It had some ... idiosyncrasies that made it a pain in the ass, sometimes, 
  but you still remember it fondly. "The ashtray smells like cheese." "Yeah, it just does
  that sometimes."
  | C++ is the same motorcycle from before, but with a fridge strapped to the top. You can 
  do anything you want, with fridgebike. It has every feature you will ever need - and 
  so easy to use!  Fridgebike.  Shh... fridgebike.
