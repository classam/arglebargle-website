  about, kill stuff, collect cogs, use them to upgrade your thingamawhatzit. \n\n<h3>
  BEEP </h3> \nPhysics in a platformer is a good idea, but that doesn't make this
  a good game. \n\n<h3> The Binding of Isaac </h3>\nCame for the off-colour subject
  matter. Tears aren't a satisfying weapon. It's not totally clear what half of the
  power-ups do.  Left because no matter of procedural content generation can save
  a game that's full of shit. \n\n<h3> Magicka </h3>\nWorth it, but only if you pay
  less than five bucks. The magic system is cleverly designed and fun to dick around
  with until you've tried all of the combinations in a variety of different situations.
  The humor is forced and awful. \n\n<h3> LIMBO </h3>\nIt starts out awesomely thematic,
  but then totally fails to deliver on the cool premise. Then it becomes a run-of-the-mill
  puzzle platformer. At least it was short. \n\n<h3> Universe Sandbox </h3> \nYou
  will spend half an hour learning approximately how it works and blowing up a few
  universes. That is all. It's too complicated to build anything of note in, unless
  you're willing to devote hundreds of hours to LEARNING. \n\n<h3> Sequence </h3>\nThe
  core gameplay is solid.  You got RPG in my rhythm game! The engine is buggy, the
  music is forgettable, and the grind sucks the fun out of a strong mechanic. Well,
  then. \n\n<h3> Bastion </h3> \nThe actual game of Bastion is a run-of-the-mill 3rd-person
  action RPG.  There is nothing run-of-the-mill about the delivery, though. Bastion
  looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, and tells a story - and they didn't skimp on
  the polish when it comes to the gameplay, either. A+. \n\n<h3> Galactic Civilizations
  II </h3>\n\nThis felt a lot like a Civilization game, even if it is by another company
  entirely. They do a lot of things better than Civ does them - wide tech tree, unique-feeling
  civilizations, powerful branching strategies, improved diplomacy, and smart AI opponents.
  \ They do some things worse, too - Civ builds a much more cohesive world map, well-thought-out
  combat, and civil management structure.\n\n<h3> Deus Ex: Human Revolution </h3>\n\nThis
  is an excellent game, and a worthy successor to the Deus Ex name. It makes a few
  irritating mistakes (don't forget: the original had its share of niggling problems)
  - the main character is a forgettable knob, the ending is unsatisfying, there's
  DLC, the boss fights are a pain in the ass, and the upgrade system really allows
  you to have your cake and eat it, too. (You want everything? You'll get everything!)
  - All those things considered, it's still great at being a Deus Ex game. \n\n<h3>
  Worms Reloaded </h3>\n\nIt's every other Worms game ever.  There's no way to improve
  on the formula. It's great at parties. Boom.\n\n<h3> Serious Sam 3 </h3>\n\nSerious
  Sam is the glorious B-Movie of video games. It's not serious, it doesn't take itself
  seriously, and anywhere where it might have taken itself seriously it puts an explosion
  instead. Like a B-Movie, enjoying it with friends is non-optional.  Infinite respawn
  on.  Respawn in place off. \n\nThere are lots of things that <em>should</em> make
  it a bad game. There are key-card fetch quests. The first three or four levels are
  boring and closed and maze-like. Occasionally a real stinker of a level comes along
  and you're doing underground platforming puzzles or something.  There's an almost
  imperceptible transition, however, to a point in the game where you are shooting
  rockets at everything that moves and running around at blazing speeds like a madman
  with a sledgehammer with a group of your friends.  Amazin'. \n\n<h3> Batman: Arkham
  Asylum </h3>\n\nIt takes a lot of buttons to be Bats - I'm used to the indie game
  three-buttons-and-you're-good world. I'm losing touch with the sort of game where
  you have to press left-down-right-trigger-right-bumper-a-b-up in order to whip a
  Batarang into someone's crotch then grappling hook to safety. The world is tiny
  and claustrophobic, the story is awful, and Batman's 'detective sense' is irritating
  and smug.  Even so, the many glowing reviews aren't _wrong_. The game absolutely
  nails anything that it tries to do. Stealth, combat, exploration... It's a good
  game. I might need to play some more to really get into it. \n\nAlso, Games For
  Windows Live. Ugh. \n"
