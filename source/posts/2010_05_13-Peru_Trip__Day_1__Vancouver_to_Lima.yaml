content: ! "Some of you might not know this, but I am on a trip to Peru, roaming around
  the Andean countryside like a macho jetsetter.\n\nWell, at least, that's the plan.
  So far it's just been a lot of sitting, something I accomplish quite handily at
  home.\n\nThe flight was... a flight.  Pretty much everything that one would expect
  from a long flight with a stopover in Los Angeles.\n\nIn fact, I could just describe
  my first day as 'a long flight with a stopover in Los Angeles' and anybody who's
  ever been on a plane would know exactly what I've just gone through. Nevertheless,
  I'm going to describe it for those persons in the audience who have far, far too
  much time on their hands.\n\nIn order to wake up for our 0710 flight, we had to
  set our alarms for the ungodly hour of 0315.  I am aware that 0315 exists, but only
  because I've been exposed to it from the 'staying up late' side of the night- I'm
  not used to waking up at 0315. It's ugly. \n\nI woke up disoriented, confused, and
  grumpy. Fortunately, we had already packed everything into Kristen's dad's car.
  \ We staggered to the vehicle and had a sleepy ride to the airport.\n\nWe blazed
  through check-in, security, and customs, and had an hour to wait for our 0710...
  wait, now it's 0800, oh wait, no, 0920 flight.  Our flight was delayed for so long
  that we worried that we might miss our PAX flight.\n\nI thought to myself, 'better
  eat while I have the chance' and happily snarfed down a crappy, greasy cafeteria
  breakfast.  Eggs, a hashbrown patty, bacon, and toast.  Om nom nom. When our flight
  was delayed a second time, I took that as a sign from the heavens above that I should
  go to the Orange Julius and pick up a bacon cheese dog and a raspberry julius. Om
  nom nom.\n\nLAX was a short, unpleasant stopover.  We found an international terminal,
  hurried, missed lunch (thanks to the late plane), and that was that - with the added
  note that American airport security really does go out of its way to live up to
  its reputation for obnoxiousness.\n\nIt would seem that planes now have a built-in
  media system - touch the screen for movies and t.v. shows.  I watched Sherlock Holmes,
  Coraline, and a single episode of the Simpsons.  I didn't watch too much television
  because the combination of the roar of the jets and the sleep deprivation gave me
  a real stonker of a headache.\n\nIn-flight food was the same as any and all in-flight
  food ever - not bad, but not good, either.  The 10-hour flight from Los Angeles
  to Lima involved two airplane meals.  The first was a greasy penne carbonara, served
  with a hard roll, a crisp salad and a surprisingly delicious little tiramisu square.
  \ Having missed lunch, I was hungry enough to snarf down the tray as well as the
  food, which left a large and comical looking square shape in my throat.  The meal
  came with reasonably good wine, which I found unusual. The second in-flight meal
  was a chicken sandwich that could only really be described as 'sad'.  A half of
  a microwaved sandwich that was more bread than meat.  It did come with a little
  salad of melon and grapes, though.  Both meals were tiny. \n\nWe finally touched
  down in Lima after 10 hours of boring ol' plane ride.  We got off of the plane,
  on one of those drivable-staircase dealies, and then took a short bus to the main
  terminal.  It took us a million years to get through immigration.  We had finally
  made it!\n\nAs our trip went on, we gradually had to deal with more and more Spanish.
  \ In Vancouver? No spanish.  In Los Angeles? A little Spanish.  On the LAN flight?
  Mostly Spanish, but with English subtitles.  Once we hit Peru, though, it was like
  we had hit a sudden wall of incomprehension.  Nothing but Spanish out here.  I have
  a phrasebook, which is turning out to be the best thing that I bought for the trip
  - with useful phrases like \"Check, please\" and \"No thank you, I do not feel like
  any cocaine today.\"\n\nWhen we finally reached the 'departures' terminal of the
  airport, we were separated, by a wall and some police, from what could only be described
  as a writhing mass of people.  Some of them were holding signs up, bellowing the
  names every now and then.  Some of them were just yelling \"Taxi!\".  I had arranged
  transport to our hotel, already, so I went up to the guy holding the \"CURTIS LASSAM\"
  board and we were on our way.\n\nDriving in Lima is different.  In Vancouver, we
  have 'lights' and 'stop signs', 'speed limits', and 'lines on the road', and you
  sort of take it for granted that the other people on the road will obey these assorted
  road rules.  In Lima they seem to be taken more as 'suggestions', as could be evidenced
  by the large number of Peruvians driving in the middle of the road at 110Km/h, cutting
  people off and loudly honking at every available opportunity.  Even from our hotel
  room, we can hear the car horns, pretty much constantly.  We even saw a \"NO HONKING\"
  sign near a major hotel.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4623417598/\"

  are billboard-laden.  I saw an ad for something called \"HAMBRIENTO!\", which I
  thought was rather spectacular.  A child juggled flaming rods at a stop sign for
  tips. A cheap, old car with \"Initial D\" stenciled on the side in a broad 80's
  font passed us.  Every ground-floor window has bars- the nicer places have fancy
  wrought-iron, the cheaper places have whatever metal they can scrounge up.  There's
  also a lot of barbed wire, spikes, some people have even broken glass and laid it
  right into the concrete.  A parkour enthusiast would soon be sliced to shreds. \n\nChecked
  into the hotel. Fell asleep.  Day 2 update soon."
