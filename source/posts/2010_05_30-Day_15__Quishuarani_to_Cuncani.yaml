  with only 30 students, across a wide range of grades.  The funds from our trekking
  provides supplies and a second teacher to this little school, amongst other things.
  \ We stop by, and they sing us a song.\n\nTrek.  Quishuarani to Cuncani.  Apparently,
  there's a friggin' mountain between these two tiny communities. The views are apparently
  quite beautiful, but I don't register most of them because I spend the bulk of the
  time staring at my feet.  Mud. Rocks. Shit. Hours and hours of mud, rocks, and shit.
  \ Everybody has their own pace, and everybody's pace is faster than mine- except
  for Kristen, who is going so slow that I am wondering how she will ever get to the
  top.   Thanks to the altitude, even the gentlest hill feels like a mountain.  Steps
  are incredibly exhausting.  Kristen is having a lot of trouble breathing, she can't
  make it up the steps.  We don't get far before one of the guides commands us to
  stop.  Kristen lies down and wheezes for air on a rock.  I stand up straight, exhausted
  but determined not to show it as much as Kristen.  Kristen is put on an ambulance-horse
  to get a free-ride to the top.  I am now alone, in the very back.  I hurry as fast
  as I can ( my pace increasing from 'sloth' to 'glacial' ) to catch up with the stragglers
  in the group.  Together, me, Nicole (another Canadian), and Richard (an Aussie in
  his sixties) form the \"Slow Group\", far behind the main group of studly Dragoman
  travelers.\n\nIt rains, constantly, drenching me and my camera.  Up, up, up.  Every
  couple of steps I have to stop and catch my breath.  I'm wet and cold and miserable.\n\nFinally,
  finally we reach the top, three hours in.  Now it's three hours down.  The trek
  goes from exhausting to terrifying, as I have to sludge down wet mud and rock along
  very, very steep hills.  It keeps raining. Today is the short walk, the 6-hour trek,
  tomorrow is the harder one.  I can't stop thinking about how terrible that is going
  to be.  We catch up to Kristen - her horse-advantage to the top being cancelled
  out by her very slow downhill pace. \n\nOn, and on, and on, three hours of wet trudging.
  \ I slip and roll my ankle on a loose rock. \n\nFinally, we see tents.  We're last
  for lunch, and the guide who was left behind to make sure we made it safely was
  clearly irritated that we had taken so long.  Our main guide had earlier promised
  us lots of breaks, but we had barely had chances to catch our breath with this impatient
  guide.  6 hours, exactly what the estimate on the brochure had said.  Apparently,
  the first team had made it to camp an hour earlier than we had, 'one of the fastest
  groups ever'.  So we're not really the 'slow' team, we're just normal, not like
  the fast team.  I change into warm, dry clothes and stuff myself into my sleeping
  bag, hoping to spend the rest of the day snugly ignoring the outside world.\n\nKristen
  drags me out of the sleeping bag around dinner time.  I don't want to go.  I'm not
  hungry, and I don't want to socialize. I'm grumpy and miserable and sore.  \n\nEverybody
  is playing a variant of \"<a href=\"http://www.pagat.com/beating/cheat.html\">Bullshit</a>\"
  and I join in. It's fun, but disorganized with such a large group and with so little
  light.  I'm barely hungry enough to eat anything for dinner.  I have a headache
  and everything in my stomach turns to acid.  \n\nI feel terrible.  It'll be worse
  tomorrow.  Ugh.  Time for bed."
