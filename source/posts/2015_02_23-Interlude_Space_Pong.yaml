secret-text: "So, I'm watching Strip Search for the second time, and this time I'm drawing comics along with the competitors, trying to keep my times under 45 minutes for the basic sketch. This was 'SPACE' + 'PING PONG'. Also spacepong.png is a great filename."

  President: The Soviets have been to space. They are the first to put a dog into orbit. The first to put a _man_ into orbit. 
  | President: This is a matter of _national pride_.
  | President: Which is why I'm happy to announce an American first. 
  | [Two men, floating above a ping pong table, holding paddles. A ball is floating motionless between them.] First man: How do we know when we've won?
  | Second man: We win when _America_ does.
