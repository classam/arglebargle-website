  Some songs I listen to in the car make me think, "what the hell, song-writer?". 

  Like Cat Stevens' "[Here Comes My Baby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGlR6oFjC3A)", where, as soon as the song hits 
  "you never walk alone; and you're forever talking on the phone", I start to think that this woman is 
  (and should be) genuinely terrified of Cat Stevens. This is a _stalker's anthem_. She is not your baby. 
  Leave her alone. The only reason I can listen to this song? [Horns!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utaWZT5N-tQ),
  
  Or the Steve Miller Band's "[Take the Money and Run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WCFUGCOLLU)". 
  Okay, it's catchy, but the song clearly
  wants you to take the side of the thieving murderers, Billy-Joe and Bobby-Sue. Why else would you tell us that 
  Billy-Joe shot a man while robbing his castle? Do people who live in nice houses deserve to get shot _more_ than
  the general population? Why do you need to tell us that Billy-Mack makes his livin' off other people's taxes?
  GRR. TAXES BAD. The man is a _public servant_. We should be rooting for him!  The song should be called "put the
  murderers in jail". Whoo whoo hoo. 

  Oh, well, at least [Dee-Lite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etviGf1uWlg) has the right idea.  Scientists have
  spent many years attempting to triangulate the precise location of Groove, and it's good to know that we have
  musicians building solid, testable hypotheses.
