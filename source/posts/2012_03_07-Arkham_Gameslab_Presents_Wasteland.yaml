content: ! "So, for the past month or so, I've been totally consumed with a different
  ridiculous project.\n\nDo not worry - I always have a ridiculous project on the
  go. \n\nAt work, I have started an impromptu board-game-prototyping club. We design
  the games, mock them up, mercilessly judge them, and steal ideas from one another.\n\nThe
  first game to approach completion? Wasteland. It's a post-apocalyptic card and dice
  game. \n\nThe rules are available <a href=\"https://github.com/classam/arkham_gameslab/blob/master/wasteland/rules.md\">here</a>,
  and the cards are available <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/projects/wasteland_v1.pdf\">here</a>.
  Should you feel the desire to mock up and play it, you'll need to provide four piles
  of dice (of four different colours) and 4 different player tokens.  You could also
  just ask me. If you're reading this, there is a 9-out-of-10 chance that you are
  a close friend of mine. (The last 10-out-of-10 is me, proofreading.) \n"
