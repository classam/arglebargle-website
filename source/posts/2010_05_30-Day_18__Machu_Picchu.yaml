  \ High, huge, imposing, interesting. A wonder of the world indeed. \n\nWe woke up
  early, walked to the bus station, took a bus to the train station, took a train
  to Aguas Calientes, and then took another bus to get to the top of Machu Picchu.
  \ I took my eBook reader along to fill some time, which turned out to be a good
  move.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was already starting to get crowded.  Machu Picchu
  felt like a theme park, like an Inca Disneyland.  Our tour guide gave us the full
  tour, walking us from place to place, showing us the best places to take pictures,
  giving us a feel for the enormous city.  \n\nNo rain, no mist, it was a beautiful,
  hot day.\n\nMachu Picchu is very, very high - although, this is sort of funny, lower
  in altitude than the city of Cuzco.  There are lots of places, however, where the
  city's stairs hang right over a seemingly endless drop.  Some of our more daring
  tourmates (and a number of llamas) stood at the very edge for pictures.  I always
  made sure there was at least a foot or two of land between me and the dizzying heights.
  Anything that the other ruins had - waterworks, sun-dials, terraces, impressive
  stonework - Machu Picchu had again, and more of it.  \n\nMachu Picchu is surrounded
  by two mountains - One named \"Machu Picchu\" (\"Old Mountain\" in the Quechua language),
  the namesake of the city, the other named \"Wayna Picchu\" (\"Young Mountain\").
  \ Anybody is allowed to climb Machu Picchu, but only 400 people a day are allowed
  on Wayna Picchu, the mountain from which the most stunning pictures are taken.\n\nAfter
  walking around the ruins, we stopped at the base of Wayna Picchu to see if there
  were any spaces left.  Well, our tour group did. Kristen was having trouble with
  the altitude, and I had no intention of climbing anything higher than a set of stairs
  after my trek experience.  There turned out to be 50 spaces left for the day, so
  a few of the most cojones-laden of our travel group decided to trek to the top.\n\nLater
  on, we got the Wayna Picchu report from Lars - even for people who are not afraid
  of heights, it was terrifying.  Thin, deep staircases, narrow ledges, and a spot
  where, in order to climb higher, travellers had to wedge themselves through a tiny
  cave on their stomachs, with no backpack (that would be too big).\n\nAfter the tour,
  I was parched.  Even in Ollantaytambo I was recovering from the dehydration of the
  trek by downing beverage after beverage, and at Machu Picchu the hot sun and lack
  of drink made me think very pleasant thoughts about the first drink I encountered.
  \n\nWe stopped at a little cafeteria outside of Machu Picchu, near the ticket booth.
  \ Everything was incredibly expensive - theme park expensive - but we couldn't help
  but buy a few frozen limonada for 10 soles each.  They were incredibly good.\n\nKristen
  and I walked back up to the Machu Picchu viewpoint to take the city in one last
  time, and then head to the buses, back to the town of Aguas Calientes, to get some
  lunch and wait for the rest of our group.\n\nAguas Calientes (\"Hot Water\", because
  there's a hot springs in the town), is a terrible little town.  The prices are theme-park
  exorbitant all throughout the town, the restaurants offered very little variety
  or interest, service was slow, and there wasn't a lot to do.  \n\nWe ended up staking
  out the slowest restaurant of the lot, so that we could chill out and wait for our
  late departure from the city.  I managed to make two drinks and two side-orders
  of fries last 6 hours, a true testament to exactly how slow a restaurant's service
  can be.  We sat and played cards and waited for more people to show up.\n\nEventually,
  it was time to leave, on a train, then a bus, then a bus back to our hotel in Cuzco.
  \ As thoroughly impressed as I was by Machu Picchu, that's how thorougly bored I
  had become of Aguas Calientes. "
