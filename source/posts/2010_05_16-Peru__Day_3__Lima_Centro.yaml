  shock of visiting Peru would be wise to consider Miraflores as a first stop.  It's
  the wealthiest district in Peru, prices are high, but there's a lot of westernization
  going on there that we didn't really appreciate as much until we reached Lima Centro.\n\n<a

  in our hotel room in Miraflores, headed out for breakfast, and found a nice little
  cafe.  I decided to try cebiche - Peru's signature dish - raw fish marinated for
  a good long time in lime, then served with onion and hot peppers - and it was good.
  \ Kristen's breakfast was a ham-stuffed crepe drenched in a hot cheesy sauce.  Delicious,
  but rich.\n\nWe took a taxi to Lima Centro.\n\nLima Centro is quite a bit more...
  well, more.  More traffic- the 'crazy driver' problem compounded by the narrow,
  one-way streets, the lack of any sort of alternative transport, and the fact that
  nobody seems to respect even the most basic rules of the road.  Each corner is a
  mad scramble, as cars will turn left or right even across multiple lanes, madly
  honking for others to get out of their way.  Trying to cross the street in some
  places is like taking your life in your own hands, but fortunately the lack of driving
  policy means that it is not long before traffic has caught itself in a great gordian-knot
  style snarl and is barely moving at all. That's the time to dash from street to
  street.\n\nThe lanes are narrower - one or two cars wide, one-way, between larger
  buildings.  The sidewalks are very small indeed.  We stopped by the hotel, noted
  the meeting time with our tour group, checked our baggage, and were off. \n\n<a

  to see the Plaza de Armas.  Spanish-planned cities are well known for often having
  a square, with an impressive palace, a church, and government buildings all surrounding
  a central area.  Even in Lima, this square is quite imposing.  Being as there wasn't
  a lot to do, aside from take pictures, we moved on.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4622941353/\"

  that, we wandered towards the Monastery of San Francisco, passing countless little
  shops and stalls, a military base, and a nice park from which one could see the
  'ugly side' of Lima, way off in the distance.  The Monastery is a large, imposing
  religious building, and they were offering tours for 10 soles - but no photography
  allowed.\n\nThe monastery was huge, and covered from top to bottom in the sort of
  aged, historical detail that one would expect from a monastery.  Each wall or ceiling
  or floor seemed to be in a different style, from a different era. \n\nThere was
  this one guy who showed up again and again - bony fellow, nailed to a tree or somesuch
  - he was plastered all over everything.  Jesus, I think his name was.  Jesus on
  the walls, Jesus on the ceilings, plastic Jesus in a little LED-shrine, Jesus Jesus
  Jesus.  It's as if he's an important figure or something.  Being as it was a catholic
  church, there were also saints and martyrs all over the place.\n\nAfter wandering
  through the monastery, we went to the catacombs - the crypt.  People have been buried
  under the monastery, believing that a burial on hallowed ground would be good for
  their position in the afterlife - for hundreds of years, only stopping in the 50's.
  The few remaining Franciscan monks in the monastery are still buried there - although
  in a different section.  As a summary - low ceilings, poor lighting, lots of stone,
  bones everywhere. A whole well full of bones at one point.\n\nAfter that, we trudged
  back to our hotel to shower, then meet up with our group.  On the way, we stopped
  for some churros, which are delicious.\n\nWe met our tour group at 6:00, and had
  a big meeting upstairs.  They covered the itinerary, some ground rules - our safe,
  for example, is to be named 'Trevor', we must never say the word 'safe' - and we
  all handed them our huge wads of travel cash ('the kitty') from which our various
  activities will be deducted.  We also did a quick 'round the table for names and
  nationalities.  3 Australians, 1 from the Netherlands, 1 other Canadian, us, and
  12 Britons.  Our tour guides are Mike, a Brit, and Gaetano, an Italian who has spent
  a significant amount of time in South America. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4623591238/\"

  (Brit), and I embarked after the meeting to try to hunt down the fountain show at
  Reserve Park.  It was a long, confusing walk in the dark, but we eventually found
  it.  They had a wide variety of fountains - fountains to walk on, to walk under,
  a lighted fountain show, little fountains, fountain fountain fountain. \n\nWe then
  walked back to our hotel, stopping for foods along the way.  I ate a bit too much.
  \ We had to wake up very early the next day. \n"
