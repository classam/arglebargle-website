  Unfortunately, ever since I've switched to the iPhone as my primary music device, just out of laziness more than anything, 
  my music library has required a lot of active curation in order to stay small enough to remain portable. 

  What I do, is I have a folder called 'iPod', synced to my iPod, which contains:

  -   "Top 100", a smart playlist containing the [100 songs with the most plays](http://curtis.lassam.net/post/2011_06_10-Sort_Your_iTunes_Library_By_Plays.html) in my playlist.
    -   I have listened to Seven Seas of Rhye by Queen over 500 times at this point. 
    -   These aren't always my most maddening favourites - these aren't the songs that I play over and over again until I'm sick of 'em. 
         These are the songs that have proven *impossible to skip*.
  -   "You've never listened to these songs", a smart playlist containing 25 songs that I haven't heard (or skipped) in the past 6 months.
    -   If you're ever curious why "Banana Phone" or "O-Town" or something comes up in my car? Blame this list.
    -   On the other hand, "You haven't heard [Frontier Psychiatrist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8BWBn26bX0) by The Avalanches in a while, Curtis".  Thanks, iTunes, *I haven't*! 
    -   That boy needs therapy! 
  -   "Awesome", a poorly named playlist (it needs alphabetic superiority so that it's easier to find in the car) containing a 45-minute or less playlist filled with songs I have stuck in my head.
    -   It's pretty much just an excuse to play the same 15 songs in a row, again and again.
  -   "Good CDs", full of complete albums that should be on the player.
  -   "New CDs", full of albums that I have just downloaded, and need a chance.
  -   And "Singles", full of good songs that don't fit into any other category.
  
  And periodically I have to go through and cut, rearrange, and decide which "New CD's" get to be "Good CDs", which of them have just one or two good singles, and which ones get thrown out.

  Some observations? 

  -  I really like Crystal Castles, but some of their songs sound like robots trying to fuck the inside of your head, and not in a particularly good way.
  -  Adele's "21" got really old, really fast. As much as she's good at what she does, a whole album of heartfelt breakup themes is not for me. 
  -  Foster The People's "Torches" gets a stay of execution just for being.. really hard to nail down. It's watered down enough that I don't even notice if it's there. 
  -  The only thing on Glitch Mob's "Drink The Sea" I'm walking away with is "Between Two Points". 
  -  Glitch Mob's "We Can Make The World Stop", though, you're a Good CD. Congratulations.
  -  Gorillaz "The Fall".  Baleeted. This is a bunch of B-sides if I ever heard any.
  -  Gorillaz "Plastic Beach" gets a temporary stay of execution for Melancholy Hill and the titular Plastic Beach.  This band leans pretty heavily on solid singles - lots of weak albums. 
  -  Justice's "Audio Video Disco"?  Welcome to the pantheon, my friend. *No question*.
    -  Yes, even Ohio.
  -  Katzenjammer's "A Kiss Before You Go" and "Le Pop". These albums are strange.
    -  They can't pull off country songs right, becuase they bring a 'norwegian pop' level of sugary happiness to them.
    -  When they try to work up some pathos, they bring in the horns and strings and start to sound like a Tim Burton movie.
    -  Or a carnival. A sad, angry carnival. 
    -  Wup, then it's back to a cheery song. What is this, a double bass, a banjo, and a trumpet? Sold. 
    -  But they grow on you. And grow. And grow. Even the songs that you hate at first.
    -  Recommend++.
  -  La Roux.  I don't know what to think. These songs are all good, but they're so samey.  
    -  I feel like I could take just one or two songs from the CD and have everything I need from them.
    -  But which ones?
    -  I'm thinking "Tigerlily", "Bulletproof", "Fascination", "Reflections are Protection" and maybe "Growing Pains"
    -  I should give this whole CD a little more car time before I make any rash decisions.
  -  Lady Gaga's "Born This Way". I downloaded this whole CD for exactly one song - "The Edge of Glory"
    -  And I think that's the only song that's going to escape this overstuffed mess. 
  -  Ladytron's "Gravity The Seducer".  Uh.  You can stay a while, because you're Ladytron, but.. this is a weak Ladytron CD. 
    -  Weeeak.
  -  Lupe Fiasco's "Lasers".  I.. I can't believe I like a CD that has 'hip-hop' listed as the genre.  
    -  In my defense, it's *really* well produced. 
    -  And Lupe doesn't say word one about 'the club', nor is he mysogynistic or violent.
  -  Pretty Lights' "Spilling Over Every Side" is solid. 
    -  I notice that shorter CD's are less likely to have bad songs. Who would have thought?
