alt-text: |
  The year is 2038. StackOverflow has become sentient. 
   All it does is deliver strong shocks to coders who use tabs and spaces interchangeably. 
   It started by trying to shock any remaining PHP coders. 
   But most of them quickly decided that the shocks were just another feature of the language. 
   When the shocks stopped, 3 PHP coders filed complaints, 
   claiming that they had built critical functionality that depended on the periodic free electricity.
