  title=\"The Watchmaker's Dilemma\">Watchmaker's Dilemma</a>. There's still an awful
  lot of work to do, but it's at least presentable. And playable.  Lots of style work
  this weekend, too - token tiles and a ticking title screen have been the main brunt
  of that. \n\nStill, though, only 11 different tokens doesn't make for much of a
  game.  A good demo, maybe, but there needs to be a lot more tokens to make the game
  an explorable experience. \n\n<h3> Upcoming Stuff </h3>\n<ul> \n<li> Kill the \"alerts\".
  Kill them so hard. They are the Worst Thing. </li> \n<li> Add some useful information
  to the error messages. (\"Try turning it off and on again.\" ) </li>\n<li> Give
  the user the option to scramble the token identifiers for added difficulty. (\"Hard
  Mode\"). </li> \n<li> More tokens! I have a notepad full of ideas for new ones.
  Marquis! Butterfly! Queen! Wallflower! </li>\n<li> Memoization for the token solution
  algorithm.  The server has to work hard enough as it is. </li>\n<li> Add a 'save'
  button. (It'll just give the user the URL to the page, but whatevs.) </li>\n<li>
  Test (and fix) against two open windows playing the same game. </li> \n<li> Style
  the backgrounds, the hint button, the new game button, the (recently added) save
  button, and the points. </li>\n<li> \"+1\" and \"-1\" animations under the mouse
  when the user gains or loses points. </li>\n<li> Give the user a maximum number
  of points. Currently it's all too easy to get up to 30-odd points and then not worry
  about the game anymore. </li>\n<li> Add a timer so that users can play against a
  clock. </li> \n<li> Try some browsers that ... aren't Chrome. </li> \n</ul>\n"
