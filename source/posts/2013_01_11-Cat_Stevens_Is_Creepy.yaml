  When I was in High-School, I frequently and vocally wondered what the point of the "Poetry" unit in English was.
 
  Isn't English at its best when clear and concise? Layers of flowery metaphor and carefully structured passages
  are just faffing about, right? My engineering bias revealed itself at a young age.  

  My Grade 10 English teacher eventually explained it to us - by focusing our assignments on pop song lyrics. 
  Song lyrics aren't usually particularly deep, but part of the fun of listening to them is that their meaning
  is presented in a restricted format - some combination of rhyme scheme and metaphor. Here is a format where
  being clear and concise is not the goal.  Instead, the goal is to create a pattern of words that _sticks_. 
  And creating sticky patterns means creating patterns that appeal to humans - with repetetive elements, with
  metaphors, with call-outs to common cultural touchstones, with short stories - and this patterned English 
  has to work in time with the music.

  This is a rather high-falutin' opening to the real point of this blog-post:  The songs I listen to in the car
  that make me think, "what the hell, song-writer?". 

  Like Cat Stevens' "[Here Comes My Baby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGlR6oFjC3A)", where, as soon as the song hits 
  "you never walk alone; and you're forever talking on the phone", I start to think that this woman is 
  (and should be) genuinely terrified of Cat Stevens. This is a _stalker's anthem_. She is not your baby. 
  Leave her alone. The only reason I can listen to this song? [Horns!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utaWZT5N-tQ),
  
  Or the Steve Miller Band's "[Take the Money and Run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WCFUGCOLLU)". 
  Okay, it's catchy, but the song clearly
  wants you to take the side of the thieving murderers, Billy-Joe and Bobby-Sue. Why else would you tell us that 
  Billy-Joe shot a man while robbing his castle? Do people who live in nice houses deserve to get shot _more_ than
  the general population? Why do you need to tell us that Billy-Mack makes his livin' off other people's taxes?
  GRR. TAXES BAD. The man is a _public servant_. We should be rooting for him!  The song should be called "put the
  hippies in jail". Whoo whoo hoo. 
  
  Also, is Aqua's [No Party Patrol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwayvfxR_Xk) about the need for the global community
  to work together to collectively head off ecological collapse? Or is it just about a particularly raucous party?

  Oh, well, at least [Dee-Lite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etviGf1uWlg) has the right idea.  Scientists have
  spent many years attempting to triangulate the precise location of Groove, and it's good to know that we have
  musicians building solid, testable hypotheses.
