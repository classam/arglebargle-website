content: ! 'Long drive to Puno.  Kristen wasn''t feeling so great.  On the way to
  Puno, we stopped at the Sillustani Ruins, great towering funeral sites built out
  of enormous rocks, at the edge of Lake Titicaca.  Combined with the sunset, it was
  all pretty impressive.


  Dinner was nondescript.  All of the Peruvian food is starting to blend together
  into one faceless mush.  Every restaurant we go to seems to have the exact same
  menu and it''s beginning to wear thin.'
