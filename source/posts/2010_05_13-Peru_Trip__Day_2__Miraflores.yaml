  Time to go explore Lima - well, the wealthy little pocket of Lima known as Miraflores.
  \n\nI'll probably not be posting pictures of our trip while we're out here.  I've
  been dumping everything I can to http://curtis.lassam.net/images/peru/ , but I don`t
  have photo editing software on Kristen`s tiny laptop (nor do I have the desire to
  fiddle around with The Gimp when I could be gallivanting about), the raw images
  are huge, and the internet is slow, so it`s taking a lot of time. \n\nWe walked
  out of our hotel, hunting for something interesting.  Oh, but first, it looks like
  we are going to need some Nuevo Soles - the currency, here.  Moneychangers walk
  the streets in droves, wearing green vests with 'Euro' signs on them and holding
  up calculators.  A sol is worth about a third of an American dollar, so the fact
  that everything in Lima is about twice as expensive as it is in Canada ultimately
  works out in our favour.  A solid fast-food burger and fries, for example, runs
  16 soles, which would be like maybe six bucks, which is... well, a little bit less
  than a burger and fries at an A&W or Wendy's.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4623042480/\"><img

  Street\" /></a>\n\nWe then ventured to \"Pizza Street\", a tourist-heavy location
  full of pubs and bars.  At 11:00 in the morning, it was totally dead.  We decided
  to come back later to see if it was 'jumpin', but we were still hungry so we stopped
  at one of the Pizza Street restaurants.  \n\nI don't understand a lot of the details
  of Spanish menus- if I'm lucky, I can pick out the important meats from a menu item's
  description, most of the time, but that's about it.  I pointed at something at random,
  and got a penne and meat sauce with cheese, garlic bread (pan de ajo) and a lemonade
  (limonata) for 9 soles, which was probably the best deal of the day. Kristen picked
  the only thing on the menu that either of us could identify, a pizza - seemed like
  a safe bet, on \"Pizza Street\".\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4623044388/\"><img

  Sauce\" /></a>\n\nThe penne with meat sauce was not so spectacular - the meat sauce
  had a sort of 'Mexican' taste to it- like it would be more comfortable sitting in
  a burrito then it would snugly nestled between warm pasta. Kristen's pizza was nice,
  if a little bit different from traditional pizza. Soft, small, round dough, very
  little sauce, mozzarella, sliced ham.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4622488965/\"><img

  Pucllana\" /></a>\n\nI had circled a few major attractions on our map of Miraflores.
  \ The first, about 8 city blocks away, was the <a href=\"http://www.go2peru.com/Lim_foto06.htm\">Huaca
  Pucllana</a>.  The Huaca Pucllana may well be one of the oldest ruins we will see
  on this trip- it predates the Inca by about 800 years, making the ruins over 1600
  years old.  It is a step pyramid, and the reason that the Incans didn't ruin it
  (as they often did with pre-Incan sites) is because it was almost entirely buried
  in a hill.  It was discovered by archaeologists only 30 years ago.  It's made entirely
  out of mud bricks.\n\nI asked, 'if it's made of mud, why doesn't it melt when it
  rains?'.  \n\n\"It doesn't rain in Lima.\".  \n\n\"Not at all?\"  \n\n\"Not at all.
  \ I have never once needed an umbrella, and I've lived in Lima all my life.  Lima
  gets about 5 millimeters of rain a year.\"\n\nYikes. No wonder it's so muggy.\n\nAfter
  wandering around the ruins for a while, we walked back to the park in the centre
  of Miraflores.  It's a nice little park, with trees, and flowers, and a concentric-circle-shaped
  seating structure in the center for people to sit in. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4623409276/\"><img
  src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4623409276_823cf45848.jpg\" alt=\"Kennedy
  Park\" /></a>\n\nWe decided, after some deliberation, to walk to Larcomar, a 'touristy'
  mall on the waterfront.  The walk was another several blocks.  We were both hot,
  and - as we were to discover later - just a little bit sunburned.  I've turned a
  mild shade of red, and Kristen has raccoon-eyes from her sunglasses (which makes
  me laugh, although she doesn't appreciate it).  \n\nThe streets of Miraflores are
  bustling, and loud, and every storefront stretches on to the sidewalk a little bit
  - the restaurants even moreso as people want patio seating.  One restaurant I saw,
  later that night, had actually extended its 'outdoor seating' down the block in
  front of two other stores that had closed.  Clever.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4623425118/\"><img
  src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4623425118_47b55b93b0.jpg\" alt=\"Larcomar\"
  /></a>\n\nThe Larcomar is one of the most beautiful malls I've ever seen.  It's
  set into a cliff right next to the ocean.  We stood on top of the mall, in a touristy
  area with a fountain and some shade, and let the cool ocean breeze ease the heat
  of the toasty, toasty day that we were experiencing. Then we wandered around inside
  the mall.  It was about time for some lunch, so we went to a Bembos - a local burger
  chain - had a \"doble queso combo\" (Double cheeseburger with fries and a drink)
  with an Inka Cola.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4622846821/\"><img
  src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4009/4622846821_78df5229f7.jpg\" alt=\"Bembos\"
  /></a>\n\nInka Cola is a local drink.  It's more popular, here, than even Coca Cola
  - so much so that the larger company bought a 50% share in Inka Cola. It's a bubbly
  soft drink with lemon and sugar flavors, and it tastes almost exactly like bubblegum.
  \ Inka Cola is very, very sweet - so much so that it makes a Coke seem like a reasonable
  drink - and I probably won't be having any more.  Kristen 'wasn't hungry' but then
  ate all of my fries. \n\nOne interesting tidbit that I picked up from our tour guide
  at the Huaca Pucllana is that 'special' is a local euphemism for 'expensive'. \n\nAfter
  we ate, we wandered to one of the extremely 'special' seaside restaurants.  The
  view was spectacular, as the entire restaurant was suspended on a cliff just next
  to the ocean.  We tried to order a seafood appetizer platter - an opportunity for
  me to try the local ceviche, a Peruvian specialty - but our inability to communicate
  in Spanish led to a mixup, and we ended up seafoodless, wondering if we would ever
  get our meal.  We ended up, 20 minutes later, getting another set of menus and were
  treated like brand new customers, as if our server had disappeared from the face
  of the planet entirely, taking our order with him.  In order to speed the arrival
  of our meal, we decided to simply order what we came for - two Pisco Sour, the signature
  beverage of Peru.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4622853261/\"

  width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"Pisco Sour\" /></a>\n\nA Pisco Sour is made with
  Pisco - a local brandy - lemon, egg whites, simple syrup (sugar cooked in water),
  and bitters. We discovered, from our first sips, that most of those secondary ingredients
  are truly secondary, and the expensive beverage that we had just ordered was mostly
  a rather large and lemony cup of brandy.  Kristen, with her low tolerance for alcoholic
  drinks, didn't like hers too much, but I quite enjoyed mine - even if it rendered
  me a little bit stumbly and loud on the walk back to our hotel room.  The Pisco
  Sour is rather like having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round
  a large gold brick.\n\nOur Huaca Pucllana tour guide - very friendly, full of fun
  stories - relayed to us a local custom in respect to the Pisco Sour - whenever somebody
  has one for the first time, he must have three.  The first one, to learn what it
  is, the second one, to remember what you just had, and the third one, because by
  that point you're drunk enough that you've forgotten everything about the first
  two times.  I was tipsy enough after the first that I thought the custom would be
  a poor decision. \n\nWe made the trek back to our hotel room to loaf about a bit
  - I had to try to connect to the interwebs, post my Day 1 notes, and change out
  of my now quite-damp t-shirt. \n\nWe then went out in search of adventure, or at
  least some dinner.  One thing about Miraflores that is perhaps a bit different from
  other cities that I've travelled, is that dinner is a great big deal.  The streets
  are lined with restaurants, each one of them with many tables, and there are people
  at all of them.  The streets are full of people, until late in the night, eating,
  drinking, and generally expressing merriment.  Miraflores is vibrant, alive. \n\nWe
  returned to the Pizza Street, as we had decided earlier,to see it all lit up. Oh,
  and lit up it was - neon lights blaring, seats filled with people, street filled
  with people, the restaurant maitre-d's fighting over customers.  Come in! Cervezas!
  Dos cervesas!  Waving their arms, trying to attract attention to their restaurants.
  \ It was a bit much, so we walked a little further and found a little cantina that
  seemed busy. \n\nWe decided to split a small order of 'chicken bites and fries'
  - I figured, if we weren't full afterwards, we could always wander off and explore
  for more food.  The 'small' order of chicken bites and fries, however, turned out
  to be quite large, a huge pile of fries with 'chicken bites' that had clearly been
  hand-breaded just moments before, served with a tangy sauce. \n\nSeriously, I was
  sitting there, thinking 'how could it take so long to dump frozen chicken nuggets
  into a deep fryer' - but no, the chicken bites were made on the spot, and they were
  excellent.  Peru's reputation as the culinary capital of South America, certainly
  reflected in the care that an out-of-the-way cantina takes with chicken fingers.\n\nWe
  stopped at a gelateria on the way back to our hotel, and ate lemon ice cream in
  the park.\n\nThe central park is full of stray cats - there is a sign in the center
  quite clearly forbidding that people abandon their cats there - even in Spanish,
  I could catch the intent.  (And, like every warning sign you might see, it is there
  as evidence that people in the area have done that thing in the past.)  The cats
  of the park, though, are friendly.  Earlier that day, we had noticed that the gardeners
  employed in the park laid out water for the cats and paid some attention to them.
  \ When Kristen and I sat in the center of a park, a small, thin, white cat slowly
  padded up to us.  He nosed Kristen's hand a little, and she gave him a pat, and
  then he decided to settle down on my lap for a quick snooze.  I sat there, sated
  with my dinner, eating lemon ice-cream, in a beautiful park in the middle of an
  exciting city, next to my beautiful girlfriend, with a happy cat dozing in my lap,
  wondering how my trip could possibly be any more fun. "
