content: ! "We woke up, each sleeping bag and few heads (mine included) covered in
  a layer of wet sand.  Wind, dew, and sand together all combined to cover our once
  beautiful campsite into a pile of muck. It was cold, and most of us had sand in
  places that we did not even know that we had had.  (Later that day, I would discover
  that I had an as-yet unknown pocket in my cargo pants that had completely filled
  up with sand.)  The night before was fun, though, so we packed up our damp gear
  and got ready to go, taking one last sandboarding run before we buggied back to
  the city.\n\nWe had breakfast at the oasis, a short affair with some eggs, buns,
  butter and jam.  After a night of camping, the real bathrooms were nice.\n\nWe took
  off once more in the Dragoman Truck (\"Gus\"), headed for a supermarket.  We've
  been divided into 'meal teams', each team responsible for a different meal.  My
  small team has been assigned 'lunch tomorrow' and given 100 soles to shop.  Processed
  foods, meats, and cheeses were all expensive, so we struggled to put together the
  ingredients for sandwiches under the budget - but we managed to buy bread, sliced
  ham, edam and gouda cheeses, tuna, mayonnaise, mustard, tomato, cucumber, and lettuce,
  all for under 100 soles (roughly $35USD).  In retrospect, if we had looked at doing
  something a little bit more 'vegetably' and a little bit less 'British', we could
  have likely accumulated a much wider range of goods for our money - heck, enough
  corn to feed the lot of us five times over, I'm sure. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4679420149/\"

  this time to our campsite in Nazca.  We set up our tents, and those of us who decided
  to take the flight (even after a few Canadians died in a plane crash here only months
  ago) waited around for a shuttle to take us to the little airport.  We shuttled
  in groups, boarded tiny planes (mine had me, Kristen, and two others), and flew
  for a solid hour over the Nazca lines, taking many pictures. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4679429361/\"

  to the campsite, to eat lunch, loaf about, chat, and relax a bit.  Nothing else
  planned today, so I resolved to hunt down internet access - which I found, as you
  can see.  I've also been charging my little e-book reader, as during the flight,
  I accidentally left it on in my bag and by about halfway through Miraflores it was
  totally drained of batteries. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4679681879/\"

  to go see if dinner is afoot- a team is making Chili Con Carne... but they're Brits,
  so let's see if they can handle it without making it bland and terrible. (Don't
  tell them I said that. ) Seriously, I would much rather turn my menu options over
  to the Peruvians than the British. \n\nIf I have a chance, maybe I'll be able to
  fit in a shower tonight - otherwise, it'll be a few more days. (Yes, I would rather
  update my blog than shower, that's dedication.) This campsite is really posh - it
  has lighted bathrooms, an internet stall, and a friggin' pool.  Tomorrow? A long
  day of driving, Chauchilla Cemetary, and beach camping at Puerto Inka.  It'll be
  a few more days before I have internet access again, so I'll see you! "
