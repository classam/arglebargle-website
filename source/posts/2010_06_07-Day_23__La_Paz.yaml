content: ! "Anus was worried. \n\nHe had a meeting in the central nervous system.
  \ Brain was very unhappy with his whole department.  Things had all gone to shit.\n\nKidney
  and Throat sat at a conference table.  Brain sat at the head of the table, looking
  impatient and more than a little angry.  There were two empty seats.  Anus took
  one of them. \n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/comics/poop/brain.png\" alt=\"Brain\"
  />\n\n\"Where's stomach?\", Anus asked. \n\n\"We're not sure,\" Brain said, \"but
  when we find out, he's in a world of trouble.\"\n\n\"I'm going to need reports from
  all of you.\"\n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/comics/poop/kidney.png\" alt=\"Kidney\"
  />\n\nKidney started.  \"We're not sure exactly what's going on here, but we haven't
  seen any water for some time, and we're starting to get into trouble.  Things are
  drying up fast, and we want to know what you're going to do about it. Bloodstream
  is just riding my back about this, so if we could get the ball rolling...\" \n\nBrain
  interjected. \"I've talked with Lips, and he's verified your report of dehydration.
  \ This is bad business - we could severely hurt ourselves here if we don't get some
  water flowing. Throat?\"\n\nThroat continued the report. \"I can vouch for some
  of the water. It came through our department earlier. If Kidney hasn't seen it,
  I'm not sure where it's gone. \"\n\nBrain glared at Anus, who embarassedly filled
  in the missing details. \"Our department.  All of the water... all of anything,
  really, it's all just come gushing out the back door.  Constantly.  We're not even
  sure where it's all coming from.  Stomach and Intestine have been sending us anything
  they can get their hands on.\"\n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/comics/poop/stomach.png\"
  alt=\"Stomach\" />\n\nJust then, Stomach burst into the room, clearly the worse
  for wear.  \"Something's wrong with Intestine! Some local bacteria got into the
  department and they are wreaking havoc!\"\n\nBrain pounded on the conference table.
  \"SILENCE.  Look, we're driving to La Paz today, and we don't intend to shit ourselves
  on the way.  I'm going to start a fever and see if I can't drum up some medication.
  \ Throat - you're going to have to deal with some puke in the near future, so prepare
  yourself.  Kidneys?  I'm going to hold off on any water until we're safely at a
  washroom, but it'll be about 5 hours. Do you think you can hold on?\"\n\nKidney
  looked unhappy about the prospect of dehydrating for any longer, but he was sufficiently
  cowed by Brain not to make a stink.\n\nBrain wasn't finished. \"ANUS! Your job's
  going to be the hardest, here. I just want you to hold on. Tight. It's going to
  be a long and extremely unpleasant journey.\" "
