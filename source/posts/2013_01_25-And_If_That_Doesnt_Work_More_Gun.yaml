  Gun control is a complex and multifaceted issue without an easy solution!
  
  As far as I can tell, there are a variety of reasons why 
  someone might own a gun. 
  
  _Hunting_, for example, is a totally legit reason to own a rifle. 
  I find hunting distasteful, but I totally understand and embrace
  the hypocrisy in being a devoted carnivore who is squeamish about
  killing his own food.  I think that anybody who can't muster up the
  chutzpah to murder a woodland creature should seriously consider
  becoming a vegetarian - it's a much more tenable moral position.
  Hunting rifles, though, are a specific flavor of rifle, and it is
  entirely reasonable to mandate a raft of home-safety controls for
  these rifles; separate ammunition, trigger-locks, and the like. 
  I mean, if you're only going to use this weapon for hunting... 

  Then there's the 'democracy' argument - on the off chance that the
  government happens to overstep its bounds and armed revolution is
  required, it would be best not to be without weaponry. It's a check
  against the power of government! A powerful, _wildly impractical_ 
  symbol of democracy! A guerilla measure of last resort! 
  I'm, not really sure what I think about
  this argument - but regardless, the trigger-locks and separate ammunition
  could still be in place for the purpose of last-minute democracy. 
  I mean, in a time of revolution,
  breaking the law would be your last concern, yeah? 

  So, then, there's the argument from 'safety'.  "I have the right to 
  protect my family.". This has kind of a prisoner's dilemma feel to it. 
  If you buy a gun in order to feel safe, you have added a gun to this 
  closed system, marginally decreasing total safety for everyone. 
  If one person buys a gun to feel safe, everybody needs
  to buy a gun in order to feel safe. Now everybody has a gun and the 
  system on-the-whole has become much less safe. 
  
  Well, at least, _I_ think 
  that universal armament would probably be a terrible idea. I imagine
  that some people see it as a libertarian utopia where law enforcement
  wouldn't even be _necessary_ because responsible, well-armed citizens 
  would keep everything neatly in order on their own. I'm not sure if 
  I share that level of faith in humanity - one Black Friday sale and the
  whole thing would come crumbling down on its ears. 
  
  I believe that universal disarmament 
  would probably make everybody safer, to no real detriment.
  
  _But_ people who work in particularly 
  dangerous fields (cops, robbers) and people who live in particularly
  dangerous areas (Detroit, cardboard boxes) are unlikely to participate in 
  such an agreement. Hunters and freedom nutjobs still have a valid claim 
  to guns. In systems where people feel that they _need_ a gun to feel safe, 
  either
  prohibition will be contravened (the "gun control only gets guns out of the
  hands of law-abiding citizens" argument) or the concept of prohibition will 
  seem so antithetical that it will never be implemented. So, universal
  disarmament is likely nothing more than a pipe dream. 

  Anyhow, people on both sides of the debate point out that the most effective
  form of gun control is .. dealing with social inequality and reducing
  media sensationalism.  Treating poverty treats crime at the source;
  Public health programs allow for vital mental health treatments;
  Getting crime out of the constant 6:00 and 11:00 news cycle 
  helps people feel safer, and people who feel safe don't seek out guns 
  in the first place. (Then, we can quietly add more bureacracy when
  nobody's watching.)
  
  Okay, so, long, boring ruminations aside, the only real conclusion that 
  I can come to is that ... 
  gun control is a complex and multifaceted issue without an easy solution!
