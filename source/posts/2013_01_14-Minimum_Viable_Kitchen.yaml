  Recently, Priceonomics posted [this](http://priceonomics.com/cookware/), the "Minimum Viable Kitchen", laying
  out the supplies that Matt Maroon found necessary to make a viable kitchen for under $1000. 

  His supplies, though, seem entirely too fancy.  I mean, I'm sure that some people can get by on nothing but 
  a microwave and some forks, but I still think that this Minimum Viable Kitchen is too.. maximum.  

  - The Thomas Keller cookbook, Ad Hoc at Home; is a favourite cookbook of my younger brother, who has finished a 
  culinary school degree.  For persons looking to seriously upgrade their cooking skills, it's an excellent book.
  But it's not a part of my kitchen - because the recipes have prep-times that rove from 'days' at the slowest to
  'hours' at the fastest. 
  > ![Ain't nobody got time for that.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8um5czsa51qawgya.gif).
  The recipes contain sub-recipes. The meats require brining. You are to prepare and use your own stock. 
  As much as I respect persons willing to spend 8 hours on a cooking project - and I do - I'm usually looking
  for things that can be prepared in 15 minutes to an hour. Think [Stone Soup](http://thestonesoup.com/blog/#)
  or [Just Bento](http://justbento.com/).
  - The KitchenAid stand mixer. It is a godsend for people making doughs, baking, or preparing cheesecakes. For
  pastry-chefs, it's a good get. I'm not a pastry chef. There are also loads and loads of kitschy single-use
  attachments for kitchen projects that you will try once and then never again, like pasta-making, sausage-extruding, 
  and iced-cream churning. 
  - Scale.  If you're a baker, or you're running a commercial kitchen, you must invest in a scale. I am neither of those things. 
  - Ice Cream Maker? Seriously? 

  I thought I'd put together a much simpler list for Bachelor Cookin'. 

  - _Pots_. 2 sauce-pots, and a stock pot.  Don't go too cheap - nice, thick ones are actually a lot less likely to burn your food. 
  The sauce-pots are good for just about anything - boiling eggs, Kraft dinner, actual sauces - and the stock pot is useful for 
  lots and lots of noodles, bigger projects (Chili, Bolognese)- and actual stock. 
  - _Non-Stick Pan_.  You _should_ go cheap on this one, because the teflon coating will wear off after a year, no matter how expensive
  the pan is.  Remember the Rules of Teflon:
    - No metal in the pan. No forks, no steel wool, no scraping.
    - Never heat a Teflon pan past 5/6 on your stove, unless you like clouds of invisible toxic gas. 
  - _Knives_.  French knife, paring knife.  I like a little sharp serrated knife for tomatoes, but that's pretty optional.
  - _Cutting Boards_.  A plastic one should do.  I like to maintain separate boards for veggies and meats, to limit cross-contamination potential.
  - _Spatula_.  A silicone spatula, one single [unit](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00mvjtoSdcGkbP/Silicone-Spatula-Bakeware.jpg)
   (rather than [two bits stuck together](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00teqTbDKlbkYw/Silicone-Spatula.jpg)) can be cleaned in SECONDS. Which
   makes it one of my favourite kitchen tools. 
  - _Dutch Oven_ and _Baking Pan_.  For putting things in the oven and leaving them there for a while. 
  - _Mixing Bowls_. For mixing things. I also eat out of these when I'm lazy, because they're super easy to clean. 
  - _Ramekins_.  It's nice to have small bowls around for.. dipping things in. Ramekins are great for this, plus they're oven-safe. 
  - _Measuring Tools_.  You know, tsp, 1/2 tsp, tbsp, cup, those things. Also, a liquid measure - one of those Pyrex glass liquid measuring cups. 
  - _Spoons_.  For serving and stirring. Ladle. Slotted spoon. Wooden spoon. 
  - _Colander_.  For draining pasta.
  - _Box Grater_.  For grating things to a variety of different widths. 
  - _Tongs_.  Tongs are great for everything. They're like long fingers that are impervious to heat. 

  That seems like just about everything.  What do _you_ think is required kitchen equipment? What would you add? What would you leave out?
