  The year is 2038.
  C++ now has every feature from every programming language. 
  Lazy evaluation.
  Predictive parameters.
  Garbage compaction.
  Macro pointers. 
  Closure metaprogramming.
  Stack shuffling. 
  Emotional introspection. 
  De-Cursion.
  Nobody has voluntarily used C++ for over 17 years.
