  <eqj^w^> boy I love being given someone else's half-done project and told to finish it :|
  <eqj^w^> gosh jolly
  <eqj^w^> and if that wasn't enough it sure is even better when I'm the one that 
  <eqj^w^> has to tell them I'm taking over
  <eqj^w^> hey buddy pal that thing you've been doing for a week? yeah just stop.
  <cube_drone_> That's not the right way to do it. 
  <eqj^w^> it sucks so bad they're making me finish it
  <eqj^w^> k thx
  <cube_drone_> 1. Buy combat boots
  <eqj^w^> ok I like it already, go on
  <tooth> implying she doesn't have them already
  <cube_drone_> 2. Kick down their door. If they don't have one, because they're at a cubicle,
  <cube_drone_> go to a hardware store, 
  <cube_drone_> buy one, and prop it up on their cubicle, then kick it down
  <eqj^w^> what if they're in ontario?
  <eqj^w^> AND in a cubicle
  <eqj^w^> ain't no one wants to go there
  <eqj^w^> but tooth is closest
  <cube_drone_> Buy the door, then record yourself kicking it down with a webcam, 
  <cube_drone_> then convert the movie into an animated gif, then print out the animated gif
  <cube_drone_> frame by frame on individual sheets of paper 
  <cube_drone_> and mail it to them using high priority overnight mail. 
  <eqj^w^> hahahaha
  <cube_drone_> On the last page, scrawl "YOUR PROJECT IS MINE. ALSO I NEED YOUR CLOTHES."
  <eqj^w^> \o/
  <cube_drone_> Then include, as the last picture, Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, naked.
