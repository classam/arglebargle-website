content: ! "I took <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/sets/72157623972867459/\">all
  of my Peru pictures</a> and uploaded them to flickr. \n\nThis was too many pictures,
  so I went through them one by one and picked out <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/sets/72157624114449879/\">my
  favourites</a>. \n\nThis was too impermanent, so I fired up InDesign and set all
  of the pictures into a PDF, in book format, made a cover in Photoshop, and then
  uploaded the whole thing to Lulu.  Now I have a 'first draft' Peru Photobook up
  on <a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/peru-land-of-dirt-rocks-and-shit/11274116\">Lulu:
  Peru: Land of Dirt, Rocks, and Shit</a>.  I don't make any profit from sales of
  the book, and the first draft goes to me, so that I can see how it looks - as well
  as catch some of the myriad errors in my blog posts. I'll post pictures online when
  it arrives - I hope it turns out well.  \n\nI also included the option for Lulu
  to distribute a <a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/peru-land-of-dirt-rocks-and-shit/11274117\">Free
  eBook</a> for me. Huzzah. "
