  Miloslav and Walt, talking in the kitchen | 
  Miloslav: Imagine being trapped in inky black quicksand up to your waist -
  your hopeless struggle to claw yourself free only hastening your demise. 
  | They stare at one another 
  | Walt: So, you're saying we shouldn't build a suite of Selenium tests
  for our app.
