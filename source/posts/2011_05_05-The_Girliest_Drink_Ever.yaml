content: ! "I have invented the girliest drink of all time. It is <em>super tasty</em>.
  \n\nI haven't decided on a name yet (clearly this is a thing that I have trouble
  with). I'm stuck between \"Unicorn Blossom\", on account of it is the only name
  in the world girlier than the \"Orange Blossom\", upon which the drink is based,
  or the \"Gin & Julius\", because that's also a valid name for the beverage. \n\nThe
  measurements are very precise. \n\n<h3> Ingredaments &amp; Nutraminos </h3> \n<ul>\n<li>
  Approximately 1.5oz gin </li>\n<li> A wee tiny bit of vermouth.  </li> \n<li> Orange
  juice. (Some) </li> \n<li> A sploop of cream. <small>\"How much is a sploop?\" \"Enough
  so that, when you pour it in, it makes a 'sploop' sound, then you stop. \" </small>
  </li>\n <li> About a tablespoon of confectioner's sugar. </li> \n</ul> \n\nTake
  all of the ingredients and shake with ice until the world comes to an end.  Strain
  into a silly two-tiered martini glass. Add a tiny umbrella if you have one. It ends
  up tasting just like a slightly-more-boozy Orange Julius. <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/images/gin_and_julius.JPG\">Beverage
