  a list of <a href=\"http://www.vanmag.com/Restaurants/Vancouvers_Best_Sandwiches\">Vancouver's
  Best Sandwiches</a> &mdash; all well and good, but when they published it, I was
  working from home. \n\nOh, but then I took a job just next to Waterfront station,
  in the very center of the downtown core. Oh, this was looking promising. Quite promising
  indeed. I would make it a quest - a quest to consume all of the sandwiches in the
  Waterfront area.  It's the sort of game where the only way to lose is not to play.
  \ \n\nCurrently, the best sandwich - the king of the hill, the top of the heap,
  the cream of the crop, the baron of the beef - is the Meat & Bread Porchetta - which
  could very well be the most delicious sandwich I've ever eaten. Roast pig, boned,
  stuffed, rolled, and cooked rotisserie-style, then diced with cracklins (skin) and
  served on a fresh ciabatta bun - then it's dressed with a splash of light relish.
  It's simple, and nothing more needs to be done to the sandwich to make it perfect.\n\nOthers
  have been tried - the Dirty Apron's roast chicken sandwich with sun-dried tomato
  and sardines (seriously) on a fresh baguette was incredible. Peckinpah's dry pulled-pork
  sandwich was a force to be reckoned with.  Finch's pear, proscuitto, and blue-brie
  baguette was formidable.  And still, there are so many more sandwiches to eat.\n\nDowntown
  is fun!\n\nIn other news, I'm single (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTxJ2QXyzSc&t=0m20s\"
  title=\"But it comes with a free frogurt!\">that's bad</a>), I just bought four
  2-terabyte USB hard drives and an Amazon Kindle (that's good), I lost 20 pounds
  (that's good), but now I work downtown and eat out constantly (that's bad), I have
  a pile of new books to work through (that's good), but I'm still not particularly
  good at C#, the new lingua franca of work (that's bad), I no longer have to work
  from home (that's good), but I no longer get to work from home (that's bad), I have
  an office full of intelligent, fun co-workers (that's good), but I have to develop
  for Windows (that's bad), I've taken up rock climbing (that's good), but I'm really
  only using it as a way to force myself to exercise (that's... okay), I'm about to
  turn 25 (that's bad), and I'm not sure what I should be doing with my free time,
  now that I don't have a job that mysteriously fills all of it (that's good). \n\nThanks
  to my apparent inability to tidy or scrub even a little bit, my apartment is approaching
  Grime Level 8: Sentience. I haven't done a new comic in a little while, because
  my comic-makin'-computer recently died (again, but in a different way), and because,
  last comic I drew, I tried it three times and absolutely hated the way it looked
  each time.  I have enough different books on the go to keep me actively busy for
  the next 500 years, but most of them are textbook sized and can't come on the skytrain
  with me. (See: Amazon Kindle, Unrealistic Hopes)  \n"
