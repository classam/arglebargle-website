  I'm going to die. Everybody is. 

  There's no reasoning with it. No bargaining with it. At best, I can eke
  out a few extra years here or there with healthy eating and science.
  To win at life is to die at 100, surrounded by family and friends, with
  just enough mental acuity to stay awake for birthdays and Jeopardy. 
  At worst, random occurrence or freak accident. 
  
  When it ends, eternal oblivion. Viewpoint, erased. All collected knowledge
  and wisdom lost. 

  [Not coping with that super well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1_syy6lJVU).  
  It is absolutely terrifying. 
  No solace in philosophy, or science, or 
  [ridiculous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategies_for_Engineered_Negligible_Senescence) 
  [longevity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_brain) 
  [schemes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics). 
  Having trouble doing anything that's not 'lying on the couch, 
  watching 30 Rock and crying'.  Most of the time, I can get things
  together long enough to do some work or interact with people, although
  it seems like my batteries start to fail much faster than usual.
  My projects, my plans, everything that I do seems meaningless.
  [Nothing is fun anymore.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia)

  It used to be that I could keep these feelings under wraps. 
  I could suppress them, keep them in the background, distract myself, 
  and feel happy for long-enough stretches of time. It's not working
  anymore, though. 
  
  Apparently, depression and other related mental health issues are pretty
  common in my family, from both sides, so there's a precedent
  for my going completely nutter-butter. 

  I probably need help. Drugs or therapy. I have both scheduled - but 
  it doesn't seem to matter so much to me if I'm happy or not.
