  came into work, groggy, having just previously come home from work, eaten, and slept.
  I badly needed a shower and I was expecting the worst. \n\nBy 1:30pm, we had hit
  our point commitment. Instead of bitter recriminations, there was boozy celebrations,
  rock-band, and beer-pong. \n\nGenerally, when it comes to software development,
  I expect that things will go awfully. Things start with camaraderie and esprit de
  corps while the project is still in its early stages, but after a couple of missed
  deadlines - the deadlines being set arbitrarily by forces out of our control, of
  course - the pressure starts to increase and the developer treats start to fade
  away. \n\nAs the project moves further and further into fuzzy incoherence, management
  starts to put more and more pressure on the developers. We don't care HOW you deliver,
  but you MUST deliver. There are _commitments_ and _contracts_, and if things go
  wrong, it's our asses on the line. \n\nOf course, being as we are developers, we
  are generally unmoved by these pleas. We want to do well, of course, but most of
  us are dead to the threat of a deadline approaching. There is always a deadline
  approaching. Management sets the deadlines, we attempt to fulfill them, sometimes
  things work, sometimes things don't, and we make or break fortunes for ties who
  sell our services to others. \n\nThis company is an especially attractive one, though,
  and so we'd like to make things work for them - comfortable Herman Miller chairs,
  intelligent coworkers, and free coffee don't come with every post. And nobody wants
  Sean to have to explain to management why we're not performing as promised. He's
  a good guy.\n\nWith the added pressure to produce software on schedule, the product
  itself becomes more and more fragile, more prone to breakage. Software developers
  who value craftsmanship look at the software and shudder. \"I built that? Well,
  it's a good thing the only people who see it, ever, will be minimum-wage-slaves
  in some hellhole in the South.\" Let's not even concern ourselves with the added
  complexity of building new parts onto a core product that would fall apart if you
  breathed on it the wrong way. Or adding new developers to the team more then halfway
  through the project. Or even the problem that the telecoms systems we're attempting
  to tack our software on to are only complete if you cross your eyes, tap your feet,
  and sincerely believe in the power of magic. \n\nThis is why software developers
  love agile methodologies - because when we think of 'agile', we imagine that we'll
  just be allowed build good products slowly and add features over time. Of course,
  'agile' doesn't mean anything like that in the minds of the sales-ties, but we can
  dream, can't we? \n\nAnyways, we get a paycheque out of it, at the very least. Us
  young ones dream of someday working for ourselves, pulling long weeks against unassailable
  odds in hopes of someday being in the positions of the ties who pull the strings.
  The older, more seasoned geeks just put on their serious faces and slog through
  it, knowing that - as much as things can ebb and flow, being a software drone is
  still a damn sight better than shuffling paperwork or flipping burgers for some
  multinational. \n\nSo we stick around, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Waiting
  for the inevitable crunch time when the pressure starts to rise and the hours start
  to stack up. \n\nAnd at iQ... that shoe steadfastly refuses to drop. It's been months,
  and that shoe remains stubbornly aloft. Our senior software geeks have a load of
  experience dealing with exactly these things, and they have just enough clout to
  keep the howling idiocy of overstuffed telecoms dickery at bay. We've even managed
  to take some numbers and charts to management and negotiate for a just-on-this-side-of-sane
  schedule. Which puts iQ light-years ahead of just about every other company that
  I've ever worked with. \n\nErâ€¦ the extremely convoluted point here is that \"iQ
  is awesome\". I keep expecting an awful telecoms integration project and we keep
  kicking ass and playing Beer Pong instead."
