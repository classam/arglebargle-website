Cube Drone 
==========
An ex-Java programmer working for a trendy startup company in Vancouver. 
Cube Drone predates the "Cube Drone" comic strip - I've been drawing him
since I worked at TELUS. 

Cube Drone is the developer. Not the team lead, or the senior developer, 
the front-end developer, the dev/ops, the back-end guy, he's the vanilla
developer. He can do all of these jobs, although none of them too well.

Lain
====
A front-end developer and designer. Lain is an avid privacy advocate, even 
if she did relent and give the Google Glass a try. She wears a heavy jacket
to work, even on hot days, for reasons that she'd rather not discuss with
you. The office is air-conditioned anyways.

Walt Rock
=========
Every team needs a project manager. Walt is that project manager. He's the Rands,
the man in touch with both the needs of his engineering team and the needs of
the C*-level executives above him - at the expense of being treated with a certain 
amount of suspicion by both. 

Don't be fooled, though - Walt's an experienced programmer as well - he just doesn't
get as many opportunities to code as he used to.

Miloslav
========
Senior developer. Vaguely eastern-European, although if you ask him where exactly 
he's from, he'll just mumble something in an unidentifiable slavic and then change 
the subject. Miloslav speaks at least four languages fluently. I don't, though, 
so don't expect him to crack those out too often. 

### Favourite Books
 * He refuses to say. 

### Details 
 * Language: Lisp
 * Editor: Emacs

Warbeard the Mighty
===================
The operations guy. A tightly-wound ball of stress and invective, he keeps all of 
the servers running. He also enjoys board games.  

### Favourite Books
 * Time Management for System Administrators
 * Pathfinder Core Rulebook

### Details
 * Language: Perl
 * Editor: Vim
 * Class: Barbarian

In order for the site to pass the Bechdel test, I'm going to need one of these at some point.

Strange Names
=============
Why does everybody have such a strange name? Well, the team communicates a lot via IRC channel, 
and they tend to go by their screen names.
