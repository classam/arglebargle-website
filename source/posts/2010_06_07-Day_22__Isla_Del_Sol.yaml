content: ! "The next morning, we were headed for the Island of the Sun, \"Isla Del
  Sol\". \n\nWe woke up early.  A few of the members of our tour had decided 'to hell
  with going out' and were just going to loaf in their hotel rooms.  \n\nWe walked
  to the pier and hopped on a boat.  This time, it was about an hour's boat ride to
  the Isla Del Sol, a beautiful little island, complete with a tiny Inca ruin. (More
  of an Inca summer home than anything.)  Sandy beaches and sparkling lakes. We walked
  to the top of the island, a short walk, and saw a grey rock formation - they say
  it looks like a grey puma, but I don't see it. Grey Puma in the Aymara language
  is pronounced \"Titicaca\", so now you know how the lake got its name.  For years,
  various tribe leaders would meet at the top of the mountains, next to the Grey Puma,
  to hold ceremonies, discuss politics and predict future harvests.  \n\nWe split
  up - half of the group walked to the other end of the island, a 3-hour journey that
  apparently wasn't overly impressive.  The rest of us walked the 45 minutes back
  to the boats, where we gradually floated over to the other end of the island.  I
  read some books on my eReader and worked on my tan.  Despite the SPF-60 suntan lotion
  that Kristen put on, she still burned to a crisp. \n\nWe floated back home late
  in the day. \n"
