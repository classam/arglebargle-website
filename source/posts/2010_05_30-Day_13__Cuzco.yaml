content: ! "The next day in Cuzco we stopped by a faux-English pub for their 'full
  English breakfast' - something that the many brits in our crew were lusting after.
  \ Eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes, baked beans, fried tomato, sausage, and tea.  The
  bacon was a little off - Peruvian bacon, or \"Tocino\", has a reddish hue and doesn't
  quite crisp up the way that one would expect it to. The potatoes were more 'fries'
  than hashbrowns, and the sausage was the driest thing in the universe.  The tea
  was imported from Britain, \"PG Tips\", but it really didn't hold a candle to my
  home-brewed loose-leaf Irish Breakfast tea.  Maybe it was a proper English breakfast,
  but it was a far cry from a proper Canadian breakfast. \n\nAfter breakfast, we visited
  a few museums - a museum of history and a museum of contemporary art.\n\nThe Historical
  museum was filled with the same-old-same-old pottery and rocks that we had been
  seeing for the entire trip.  Okay, we get it, the Pre-Inca and Inca liked their
  pottery and rocks.  The upstairs half of the museum was full of Spanish artwork
  - the only thing in the world more monotonous than pottery and rocks.  At least
  the natives had a diverse pantheon of animal and earth gods.  All of the Spanish
  artwork revolves around the same Jesus fellow looking progressively more beaten
  and battered, and then an army of apostles, martyrs, saints, friends, well-wishers,
  and miscellaneous.  The one thing that the historical museum had that <em>was</em>
  impressive was the first and only piece of non-religious Spanish artwork that I've
  seen in Peru.  With a placard saying that non-Catholic Spanish artwork was quite
  rare (so I've gathered.)\n\nThe Contemporary Art museum was ... well, full of the
  sort of confusing, obfuscating art that Emily Carr types love to wank endlessly
  over.  Canvas covered in blocks and squares and abstract imagery, yugh.  Upstairs?
  \ A whole hallway of potato-themed art. \n\nYes, you heard me, potato-themed art.
  The art gallery doubled as a convention center, and they were having a potato convention.
  \ In order to get in on the potato goodness, the art gallery had put out dozens
  and dozens of potato-related artworks.  Pictures of potato farmers holding their
  potatoes.  Tasteful nudes with potatoes obscuring the naughty bits.  Potato spirals.
  \ Paintings of potato farms.  Potato potato potato.\n\nWe decided to eat lunch at
  a fancy restaurant.  It was expensive, and slow, but pretty delicious.  We shared
  tempura-battered shrimp, fish, and vegetables with a sweet-and-spicy chili dip.
  \ I had roast duck served with a port reduction and 'asian greens', and Kristen
  had braised alpaca with a sagey sauce.  For dessert, I had a chocolate souffle,
  with some mango goo, that was... okay. It was soft and moist, but the flavor was
  lacking.  Kristen's dessert was more like a marshmallow that had been flattened
  and fried, and I could barely stomach it. \n\nAfter the museums and lunch, a briefing
  - the itinerary for the upcoming Andean Community Trek, and a small sack to fill
  with travel essentials.  We spent the rest of the day packing and preparing.  Another
  early day, tomorrow."
