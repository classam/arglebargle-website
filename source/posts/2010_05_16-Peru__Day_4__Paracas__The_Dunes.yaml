  market with Kristen the day earlier, and I tested it in the morning - it worked
  like a charm. I couldn't find a good travel alarm clock in Canada, but this one
  is exactly what I wanted - AA battery, one dial to set the time, one dial to set
  the alarm.  A loud beep. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4622992787/\"

  I was sharing the room with staggered out of bed, dressed, sorted our luggage and
  headed downstairs.  We loaded our bags on to the Dragoman truck - a huge Mercedes
  beast, clad in metal and oversized tires - and settled in for a long drive.\n\n<a

  a little island town which we hit around 1:00ish.  We all got out, enjoyed a stretch,
  and were corralled to the docks, where we boarded some tourist boats.  Lifejackets
  on, we were off once again.  \n\nOne thing I may have failed to mention, so far,
  is that Peru is hot. Very hot.  And misty.  No rain, remember.  I woke up feeling
  that sort of warm-heat-nasty combination that I get in the heat, but blazing along
  in a speedy boat along the ocean in shorts and a t-shirt turned out to be quite
  pleasantly cool.  I felt refreshed, and the velocity made for a certain adventure.\n\n<a

  Ballestas islands, and floated around them, taking pictures of the impressive rock
  formations and hundreds upon hundreds of birds.  Also? Sea lions and penguins on
  these rocky outcroppings, all of them fueled by the ample and bounteous ocean snacks
  below.\n\nThere are so many birds on this island that, every five years, they send
  a team to harvest the 'guano'.  It takes 100 men 2.5 weeks to get it all, and they
  haul it back to the mainland to sell to farmers.  Pleasant job.\n\nI took a few
  hundred pictures.  Mussels, birds, birds, birds, sea lions, rocks, rocks, penguins...\n\n<a

  to have lunch at a seaside restaurant.  I was thinking 'hey, maybe some chicken,
  some meat', but looking at the menu knocked some sense into me - the menu listed
  about 8 different types of fish (sole, sea bass, peruvian grunt...) and as many
  different ways to prepare the fish- fried, raw with lime, breaded and fried, with
  garlic, with spices...\n\nI ended up having the Peruvian Grunt, breaded, fried,
  and then topped with ample lime.  Kristen downed a plate of buttery, cheesy scallops,
  still in their shells.  I pointed out to Kristen that she seemed to be accumulating
  cheesy, cheesy dishes whenever she had the opportunity to pick her own meals.  She
  seemed okay with that.  I had a jugos de pina (pineapple juice) with my meal. \n\nOne
  thing I may not have pointed out yet is that Peruvian restaurants all have a wide
  selection of \"Jugos\" - juices.  Usually, they make the juices right on site with
  fresh fruit.  Fresh fruit and vegetables are very inexpensive, it would seem- it
  is the meats and cheeses that are more expensive.  Fish are also plentiful, at least
  along the coastline. Every shop seems to have a wide and varied seafood menu, as
  well as a 'jugos' menu containing fresh juices.  Nice.\n\nAfter we finished our
  meal, it was the road for a few more hours - on to the sand dunes. \n\nThe sand
  dunes are like every desert you've ever imagined.  Huge, sandy dunes as far as the
  eye can see in every direction.  We stopped at an oasis stocked with sand buggies,
  hopped on, put on our seatbelts, and were whisked away on another adventure - a
  high speed ride through the dunes, complete with dizzying drops and baffling climbs.\n\nEvery
  now and then we would stop at a particularly high dune and be issued sandboards.
  \ We would be responsible for getting ourselves to the bottom.  This involved getting
  face-first on the board and sliding down on our bellies, which was fun, but also
  involved a rather spectacular amount of sand in our faces.  I made the mistake of
  going down the first hill with my mouth open. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/4679963170/\"

  middle of the dunes to make camp.  We had a fire, and our gracious hosts turned
  it way down and used it to cook chicken, sausage, and skewers of chicken-sausage-and-vegetables,
  all served with a big salad of assorted vegetables.  I ate better in the dunes than
  I do when I cook for myself at home, that's for sure.\n\nWe drank a beverage that
  our traveling mates have dubbed 'Piscola' - a potent mixture of Pisco, Coca Cola,
  and Lime, with ice.  Woogh.\n\nWe rolled out our sleeping mats and bags, and slept
  under the stars - well, there were really no stars to sleep under, as a misty fog
  had rolled over us from the ocean."
