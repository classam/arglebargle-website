content: So, having developed a pretty severe case of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller%27s_diarrhea">Traveler's
  Diarrhea</a>, I spent most of Day 24 convalescing.  Yesterday, I'd treated it with
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin">Ciprofloxacin</a>, a powerful,
  dangerous, prescription-only antibiotic that I had taken along just for such an
  eventuality. (See, well-prepared!)  Thanks to that, most of the more-critical symptoms
  - fever, nausea, diarrhea - had subsided, but I was still feeling terrible- barely
  able to keep anything down, sore.  Needless to say, I did not explore La Paz to
  the fullest.
