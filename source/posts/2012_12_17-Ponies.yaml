  Going through one of my old notepads, I found this: 
  
  "Okay, I have a sick day, I'm going to start watching. 

  - Seriously, "Twilight Sparkle"? The fuck is this. 
  - ... Do they just say throw in the word "pony" every now and then? I mean, I'm a human, but I don't spend my time in humanville, practicing human programming and human art. 
  - Oh, hey, she has a magical protrusion! So do I! Mine makes goo and awkward situations!
  - What do these ponies have against clouds? 
  - Tight-fitting... pony corset? The fuuuuuck? 
  - The ecology of this world requires SO MUCH ACTIVE MANAGEMENT.
  - This world works exactly the way that 6-year-old-girls imagine a world would work. 
  - They're all _really_ terrified of the princess. Is.. is this a dictatorship? 
  " 

  And then the notes stop. Clearly I was taking notes for some kind of snarky article. 
  It never happened, though. I must have become distracted by brightly animated 
  musical numbers. 

  I'll maintain that Equestria is a benevolent but ultimately sinister dictatorship, though.
  All of the key signs are there:

  - Political enemies are vilified, and permanently exiled. 1000+ years of solitary confinement may qualify as cruel and unusual. 
  - Twilight, the Princess's only pupil, is terrified of what might happen if she disappoints the Princess, to the point of borderline mental breakdown. She's _seen_ what happens. She _knows_. 
  - Everybody else is terrified of the Princess, as well. 
  - The previous government, a council-based democracy, is depicted as ineffective, argumentative, and ultimately useless. 
  - At the seat of government, the only obvious positions of leadership are military. 
  
  Plus, overthinking children's cartoons is just way too fun.
