  <Suit is standing in front of a chart, on a Google Hangout> Suit: This quarter, we're seeing increases in our KPI, our ARPU, our CAPEX and our WAGYU. | 
  Suit: Money is up, anti-money is down, and we are on track to make a lot of money next quarter. |
  Cube Drone: Oh wow. Inspiring.
  Lain: Do you think if we worked harder we could make them even _more_ money?
