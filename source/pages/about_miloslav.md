Miloslav
========
*Senior developer*. Vaguely eastern-European, although if you ask him where exactly 
he's from, he'll just mumble something in an unidentifiable slavic and then change 
the subject. Miloslav speaks at least four languages fluently. (I don't, though, 
so don't expect him to crack those out too often.)

Miloslav is pragmatic, has successfully completed a lot of projects, and likes to
project an air of competence, authority, and grumpiness.

[Upon discovering his first gray hair he shaved his entire head](http://cube-drone.com/2014_06_15-Cube_Drone-78_A_Moment_Of_Weakness.html).
Some say out of vanity. Some say it was revenge.
