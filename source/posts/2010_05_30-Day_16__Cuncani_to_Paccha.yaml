content: ! "On the hardest day of the trek, I woke up cranky.  It was an 8 hour walk,
  that day, five hours of it uphill.  I remembered how miserable the three hour uphill
  walk had been the previous day.  \n\nI wasn't hungry, and I tried my best to brush
  off breakfast.  The impatient guide was already poking the slow team.  \"We'll try
  to keep everyone together more today.  The slow team... maybe you can leave earlier?\"
  \ One person was taking more time with breakfast. \"Oh, you're fast, take as much
  time as you want.\"  Ass.\n\nKristen was angry at me for being so grumpy.  Can't
  blame her, I wasn't exactly a barrel of sunshine.  \n\nWe started walking up the
  mountain.  This time, I left Kristen behind - we both figured that she was going
  to need to be carried up by horses, and I didn't want to be left all alone, again.
  \ \n\nThe walk up the mountain was every bit as exhausting as the day before, but
  it didn't seem quite as bad as the day before.  The impatient guide had gone ahead
  with the fast group, and our guide this time was a cheery fellow who urged us to
  take frequent breaks and not to push ourselves too hard.  The trek was just as hard,
  but it was sunny out and our happier guide made me happier, too.  The miserable
  started to wear off as I wandered up the mountain.  I looked back, and Kristen seemed
  to get further and further back in the distance. I wondered if she was moving at
  all.  Soon, we lost sight of her.  \n\nA little bit later, one of the guides came
  jogging up.  \"Kristen's with Lares. Do you want to go with her?\"\n\nLares? Lares
  was the name of a nearby town, but how could she be with a town? I guessed that
  \"Lares\" was the name of the horse that she would be riding up the hill.  No, I
  didn't need a horse, I was still getting myself up the mountain, slowly but surely.
  \ The guide jogged backwards on the trail, I figured to meet up with the horses.\n\nThe
  guide came back and walked with us a while.  I looked back again a little later.
  Still no Kristen, still no horses.  How odd.  \"You'll meet up with Kristen at Ollantaytambo.
  She'll be taking a bus from Lares.\" \n\nOh. Lares. OH. It finally dawned on me.
  \ Kristen had gone back down, probably at the suggestion of one of the trek guides
  who, watching her pace, estimated that she would reach the top sometime around the
  end of the month.  She would take a horse to the town of Lares, and then bus to
  Ollantaytambo, the end of the trek. \n\nI was worried.  What if she was lonely?
  \ Or sad that she couldn't make the trek? An unescorted tourist girl in South America
  could get into trouble.  I asked if I could go back with her.\n\nThe guide hemmed
  and hawed.  \"Well.. she's probably already on the bus.  It's probably better if
  you just meet her at Ollantaytambo. We're near the top, anyways.\"  I could see
  that he really didn't want to have to go through all of the trouble of taking me
  back down the hill. \n\nWell, okay, I decided to go on.  We were about an hour and
  a half in - nowhere near the top.  Walk walk walk walk. Up up up up.  It seemed
  that at the top of every hill, at the top of every set of stairs, was another hill
  and then another set of stairs, all crudely assembled out of rocks.  We climbed
  to 4700m, almost a kilometre up, high enough that moss stopped growing on the rocks.\n\nI
  was dehydrated and feeling the altitude fiercely.  I had barely eaten anything the
  previous day, nor had I had a lot of breakfast (nor would I eat a lot of lunch or
  dinner) - and breathing heavily was taking a lot of water out of me. Near the top,
  I could barely breathe.  Stopping to catch my breath took longer than climbing up
  steps.  (It was bad at the bottom, thanks to the altitude, but near the top it was
  nearly unbearable.) But then, I made it.  4700m.  The highest point on the trek.
  \ \n\nI didn't take many pictures on the way up.  I was too tired to get my camera
  out of my pack, take off the cover, turn it on, ugh. I could barely walk, let alone
  take pictures.  I really wish I had taken a picture of or from the top, but at that
  point I was doing my best to stand up straight.\n\nIt was all downhill from that
  point on.\n\nFrom that point, the trek was easy.  Downhill!  It wasn't muddy or
  slippery anymore, and this downhill trip was through a series of gentle valleys.
  \ A few hundred meters down and there were actually trees!  Trees and lakes and
  grass, all surrounded by mountains, following a river down, waterfalls everywhere,
  beautiful.  This must be the payoff for all of that godawful climbing.  But the
  best part was that there was no more climbing to do.  Every bit of uphill had been
  exhausted, and the entire remainder of the trek was sweet, sweet downhill. Trees!
  Lakes! Eventually, we reached the tents.  Such beauty a man has never before seen.
  TENTS. \n\nOne thing to note- such a trip would be impossible without my excellent
  boots - waterproof, comfortable- my feet were a little sore after the trek, but
  nowhere as near as sore as my legs, back, arms, or lungs.  No blisters, few sore
  spots.  And when they say 'waterproof', they mean waterproof- the Gore-Tex in the
  boots stood up to being immersed ankle-deep or worse in streams and muck. \n\nMy
  other essential travel-buddy was my walking stick- in this case, a telescoping Manfrotto
  unipod for my camera.  The sturdy-but-light steel construction and grippy top and
  bottom made it, in my opinion, one of the best walking sticks on the journey.  For
  climbing, it telescoped in to a reasonable length so that I could pull myself up
  rocks and stairs. For descending, it telescoped out to a very long length so that
  I could hold on to something while lowering myself down.  Thanks to the 'third leg'
  extra stability that it provided, I saved myself from sprains and some potentially
  very nasty falls thanks to the many loose rocks on the trail. \n\nWhen we reached
  the tents - around 4:00ish - I got in my tent, took off my grimy trekking clothes,
  got in my sleeping bag, and didn't leave said bag for the rest of the day or night."
