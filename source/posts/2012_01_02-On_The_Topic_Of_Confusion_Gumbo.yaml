content: ! "Good afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of new-years
  resolutions, am attempting to cook for myself. \n\nOne resolution I made was to
  cook 50 things for myself. No pre-fab meals, either.  I have a tendency to just
  go to town on a box of Macaroni and Cheese or some frozen dumplings for dinner.
  \ Nope. Doesn't count unless I do something a little more ambitious. \n\nThe project
  begins tonight. The only problem is that my kitchen is, at the moment, not well
  stocked for any particular meal. Thus? \n\n<h3>Confusion Gumbo</h3> \n\nConfusion
  Gumbo is the name that I have given to this thing that I am making.  It is constructed
  out of odds and ends that I found in my fridge, freezer, and spice rack.\n\nNow,
  a traditional gumbo is a seafood-laced stew/soup, thickened by a dark brown roux
  or file powder. Confusion Gumbo is a gumbo in name only. It bears no relationship
  to anything that could be called a gumbo, and, in fact, is not a gumbo at all. \n\nI
  started by putting 2 cups of quinoa into my rice cooker.  I hit the 'white rice'
  button and started on other things.  My rice cooker has only ever done 2 cups of
  anything (2 cups being the smallest available measurement), and it has only ever
  been used on 'white rice' mode.  I imagine that, if I were to try to cook 6 cups
  of white rice in there, it would explode out of sheer bafflement. Rice would be
  everywhere. \n\nThen, I diced half of a big purple onion that I had sitting in my
  fridge. (I'm not sure if 'big purple onion' is the correct terminology, here, but
  it's evocative enough. ) I started it sweating in some vegetable oil, waited a bit,
  and then tossed in some cubes of spinach from the very, very back of my fridge.\n\nAfter
  the cubes of spinach had started to morph from cubes into spinach-shaped globs,
  I tossed in the last of my frozen shrimp. \n\nThen what? Even my spice rack is pretty
  bare. I've got ... uh... italian spices. Okay, tomato-based is a direction we can
  go, I guess. NOW IS THE TIME TO ADD RANDOM THINGS! Tomato paste! Chicken stock!
  Rooster-brand chili-garlic paste! Worcestershire! Sun-dried tomatoes! Garlic powder!
  Kosher salt! Basil paste! \n\nAaand, mix with the finished quinoa! \n\nIt's... it's
  actually pretty tasty.  If a bit confusing. And not at all a gumbo. \n\nCONFUSION
  GUMBO! \n\nOkay, that's one point for home-cooked meals. Only 49 to go! "
