content: ! "On Day 25 we checked out of our hotel at noon and then took a taxi to
  the airport.  La Paz is huge.\n\nI don't really need to talk much about the airport
  ride home.  It was 26 solid hours of waiting in either airports or planes, nothing
  special.  Children screamed.  My stomach was still a bit raw from the last few days,
  so I ate very little.  Lima had thick, breathable air, but it was hot and sticky.
  \ Los Angeles was characteristically unpleasant.  I was very happy to be home. Oh,
  sweet Vancouver! \n\nWhen I got back, Mom and Jonathan were waiting for me at the
  airport.  We drove home, and I felt well enough to take Mom and Little Dave and
  Naomi out for burgers at White Spot.  Dave's daughter, Mikhaila, is very cute and
  tries to fit everything in the world into her little baby mouth.  Dad and Tracy
  are still at the <a href=\"http://theglenatmaplefalls.com/\">cabin</a>, so I'm looking
  forward to seeing them again, with the dogs. \n\nNow it's time to get back to work
  - finish a couple of big projects, hunt for an apartment, attend a wedding, graduate,
  lots of important stuff coming up. \n\nThus concludes the trip.  I'm just now uploading
  all of the images to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31323155@N04/\">flickr</a>,
  a process that's going to take a while because I took over 1000 pictures.  I set
  up the tiny laptop downstairs, it's uploading the pictures as best as it can while
  it displays the images on a loop, like a picture frame.  Soon I'm going to take
  my favourites, combine them with my blog posts, and make a Peru Book for me and
  Kristen.\n\nThanks for reading!  "
