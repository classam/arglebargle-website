content: ! "Good afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of boobs
  and explosions, have just watched <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dzikBZTUy8\">Sucker
  Punch</a>. \n\nAt the beginning of the movie, a friend of mine suggested that it
  would be funny if, as a 'special 4D feature', they turned the lights off and punched
  us in the face in the middle of the movie. \n\nAfter the movie, we all agreed; that
  would have been an improvement. \n\nThe trailer doesn't provide anything but eye-candy,
  so you might be wondering how the plot manages to somehow tie together a mental
  institution, a bordello, a magical swordfight against giant samurai, a futuristic
  city, and world-war-two style zeppelins.  I thought to myself, 'if the director
  can make all of these things fit into a story that is even remotely watchable, the
  movie must be worth seeing.'  No? Damn.\n\nLet's start with a quick synopsis, then,
  to begin.  I'm going to SPOILER this bad boy up for you, because I <em>do</em> want
  to spoil the surprise. \n\nThe movie starts with a hackish monologue about how everybody
  has a guardian angel.  This has no plot significance until the very last lines of
  the movie - and, being how 95% of the cast are either complete monsters or tortured-and/or-murdered
  little girls, these guardian angels are clearly about as useful as a meat-shirt
  in a bear cave. \n\nMain Character Girl's mother dies, her Evil Stepfather beats
  her mercilessly, kills her sister. She shoots him non-fatally - take THAT, shoulder
  - and then, instead of finishing the job like a boss, lets him live and runs off
  into the sunset.  \n\nThanks to the still-perfectly-alive and mostly unharmed Evil
  Stepfather, Main Character Girl is almost immediately caught and dragged to a mental
  institution for girls, where a greasy orderly agrees to fudge some papers so that
  she will be lobotomized. \n\nFive days pass almost instantly, she's plunked into
  a chair, and a doctor takes a little railroad spike and hammer and prepares to stab
  it into her face - advanced lobotomy medicine in the 60's. Just as he is about to
  give her the ol' brainy-doo, it's hallucination time.\n\nOkay, so, in the hallucination,
  she's been plunked into an imaginary bordello that's almost exactly the same as
  the mental institution - same layout, same characters, everything.  The greasy orderly
  is now a greasy pimp, selling the women to the highest bidder.  The pre-pubescent
  girls are now (much older) dancers-slash-prostitutes who work - on fear of death
  - in the bordello-prison. And the main-character girl is going to have her virginity
  sold to \"The High Roller\" in five days - I guess a metaphor for her lobotomy,
  and we've gone back five days in time? \n\nThere's a brief cut-scene where she saves
  one of the girls in the bordello from some murder or rape or something. \n\nIn order
  for her to operate in the bordello at all, she is going to have to dance.  So she
  tarts up (and she clearly looks about 13 years old, so instead of going 'hubba hubba'
  you go 'oh, oh my dear, take off that makeup. I'm going to get you a comfy sweater
  and some tea.' ) and everybody stands around to watch her dance - but she can't.
  She freezes up.  And then she goes into another, even more hallucinationy hallucination,
  where her guardian angel - an old man - equips her with a sword and a gun, some
  cryptic instructions, and turns her loose on some giant robot samurai to fight.
  \n\nMain Character Girl immediately becomes some kind of crazy martial artist.  If
  you've seen 300 or Watchmen, you've seen what this particular director has to offer
  in the ridiculous special effects deparment - crazy arm-wobbly jumps, lots of slow-motion-weapon-throws,
  and eye candy that's gratuitous and unsatisfying.  Maybe there's some subtext about
  how powerful the girl is in her hallucinations and how powerless she is in real
  life, but at this point we're two-hallucinations-in and nothing in her dreams seems
  to even remotely matter to the plot.  But take that, imaginary samuraibot. \n\nShe
  returns from her hallucination, back to the bordello hallucination, where apparently
  her time spent in drooly-martial-arts land has manifested itself as a fabulous and
  hypnotizing dance (that is only ever mentioned, never seen). \n\nShe formulates
  a plan based on advice from the old-man-guardian-angel-guy. She's going to collect
  4 items - a map, a lighter, a knife, and a key - which will allow her to escape.
  \ She enlists the aid of the other bordello-ettes, who also want to escape, because
  the bordello is also a prison for some reason.  Her scheme is to use her drooly-martial-arts-hallucination-hypnotization-dance
  to distract key persons while the other girls steal the items that she needs to
  escape. \n\nSo, then, that happens a bit - each drooly-martial-arts-hallucination-hypnotization-dance
  is accompanied by a breathtaking and silly action scene, where Main Character Girl
  and the Bordello-Ettes fight steampunk-nazis and dragons and future-robots while
  wearing very skimpy military gear. In between, we get little Bordello cut-scenes
  showing us that blah blah blah Bordello Girl #1 has a bit of personality and blah
  blah blah Greasy Pimp Man is actually a horrible stabbity-rape machine.\n\nIf you've
  seen a few movies (admit it, you have) - you know that there's an iron-clad law.
  \ Everything needs to go to shit at the end of the second act. So Greasy Pimp Man
  learns about the escape plot, shoots a bunch of the girls, and tries to rape Main
  Character Girl.  She - with the knife that she acquired earlier, during one of the
  hypno-dance-martial-arts-sequences -  stabs him. Once again, it's a stab in the
  shoulder and she utterly fails to complete the job. \n\nMain Character Girl and
  Bordello Girl #3 manage to almost escape using the items that they've acquired.
  \ Oh, except they never made a plan for getting from the front door to the street.
  \ So now, Main Character Girl gives herself up so that Bordello Girl #3 can escape.
  \ \n\nSo then we go back to the mental hospital, and *tap*, Main Character Girl
  gets the lobotomizer to the eye.  So that's the end of her story. Some time is spent
  revealing that the Bordello hallucinations were pretty closely tied to the actual
  reality of her stay. During her stay - she (at least) stabbed an orderly and helped
  another girl escape.  Oh, so the Bordello-that-was-just-like-a-mental-hospital was
  actually just a mental hospital after all. \n\nBordello Girl #3 almost gets away,
  but then Scary Mean Cops find her - but wait, she's saved at the last minute by
  the old man who appeared in Main Character Girl's Kung-Fu Dance Hallucinations,
  who is actually just a bus driver.  And a guardian angel, too? There's a closing
  monologue about guardian angels again, but these guardian angels must have seriously
  dropped some balls.   Somewhere in Guardian Angel headquarters, people are losing
  JOBS over this.  \"You're demoted to Cupcake Angel, you useless twit.\" \n\nOkay,
  so, that's the movie.  Now let's start talking about the many, many ways that this
  managed to completely disappoint.  \n\n<ul>\n<li> Why the Bordello? It was clearly
  just an excuse to swap some 12-something girls for 19-something-girls and put them
  in scanty attire for every. single. scene. This comes at the expense of introducing
  Australia-sized plot-holes. \n \n<ul>\n <li> First of all, the Bordello-Prison hallucination
  was every bit as bad as the mental hospital.  Why would a girl go to all of that
  trouble to hallucinate something that was <em>just as horrible</em> as the thing
  she was experiencing? </li>\n<li> Most of the plot-advancement in the Bordello-Prison
  depends on Main Character Girl's hallucination-fueled dance abilities.  How did
  she manage these things in the plain ol' mental hospital?  It's made clear that
  the Bordello-hospital characters and activities were a close approximation of reality,
  but then... what about the magic-dancing-powers?  </li>\n<li> In Bordello-Prison-hallicination
  land, the Greasy Pimp character shoots 2 girls in the head.  In Normal Mental Hospital
  land, this seems like the sort of thing that (for a hospital orderly) would at least
  garner some negative attention.  You know, a written reprimand or something. Either
  that or large parts of the main plot didn't happen at all, which is almost worse,
  because - well, then - who cares? </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>Every single non-guardian-angel
  male character is a <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster\">complete
  monster</a> in <em>exactly the same way</em>.  They either rape, murder, rape and
  murder, or murder-murder-rape women. This is <em>so lazy</em>.  It's like they didn't
  want to spend time developing credible, well-rounded, any-dimensional villains,
  so they just said 'welp, let's toss them on the <em>likes-to-hurt-women</em> pile'.
  \ I mean, It's not like I don't hate these characters - it works - but it's just
  such an unimaginative and emotionally manipulative way to get us to hate a character.
  \ \n\nThink of the recent Christopher Nolan Batman movies - every villain has had
  a distinct motivation, they're all flawed in different ways - and even if they're
  vile, vile people, they're somehow fascinating to watch.\n\nNope, not in Sucker
  Punch.  \n\n<strong>\"How do you know they're bad guys?\"</strong>\n\n\"Well, they're
  every male character.\"  \n\n<strong>\"What did they do that makes them bad?\"</strong>\n\n\"They
  do bad things to women.\"  \n\n<strong>\"All of them?\"</strong> \n\n\"All of them.\"
  \n</li>\n<li> There's a lot of build-up about the \"High Roller\" character that
  is eventually going to visit Main Character Girl. He gets literally 0.5 seconds
  of screen time and then disappears forever. Don't worry, though - based on the Easy
  As Pie Villain Formula that this director uses, I'm pretty sure that The High Roller
  is scary because he's either a rapist, a murderer, or a little of both. </li> \n<li>
  This is a movie that is 1/3rd set IN A MOULAN-ROUGE STYLE BORDELLO. Half of the
  cast is composed of what appears to be 19-year-old women wearing corsets and lacy
  undies. Without any sexy-times. No sexy dances. No stripperific scenes at all. Not
  even so much as a nipple. If you're going to base the bulk of your movie on objectifying
  women, at least have the common decency to get some bang for your buck. \n</li>\n<li>
  In fact, the PG-13 feel of this movie starts to shine through at about the halfway
  mark, when you realize that - even considering the incredibly dark subject matter
  - the only kills have been to steam-nazis (no blood), dragons (no blood), robots
  (no blood), completely-armored knights (no blood), and then a few bloodless stab-wounds
  and off-screen shootings-in-the-head.  Guh. \n</li> \n<li>\nThe villain development
  was really weak, but they still pulled all of the buttons that made us hate them.
  \ If you casually rape and murder women, you have to die by the end of the film.
  You have to die slowly and horribly. Anything less than this is getting off <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini\">unacceptably
  easy</a> - and here, the main character had a chance to dispatch at least two of
  the most horrible characters... and she utterly fails, leaving them both alive.
  \ <em>At best</em>, at the end of the film, they're both going to jail. Maybe. \n</li>\n<li>\nThe
  character development was really weak, so... uh, Bordello Girl #3 was saved. Woo.
  Over the course of the movie, she was shown to have exactly one personality trait
  - 'protective of her sister'. Just the one. That's it.  And that gave her more character
  development than, say, Bordello Girl #2 (\"Her name is Blondie.\")\n</li>\n<li>
  Movie law.  Only serious, thoughtful movies are allowed to have bittersweet or sad
  endings. Ridiculous action shootouts must end with blood and glory and <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Commando\">Arnold
  Schwarzenegger killing a whole island of rebels to get his daughter back</a>. \n</li>\n<li>\nAt
  the beginning, they go out of their way to set up a 'stage/theater' theme that they
  totally fail to follow through on. Way to drop that ball. \n</li>\n</ul>\n\nI could
  go on and on, but 1800 words of whining is enough for me. \n\nSucker Punch is a
  bad movie.  If you're looking for the same experience, but way better, just watch
  Commando, then some pornography, then <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=300\">Commando</a>
  again. In fact, I think I might go do that now. \n\nMatrix: Remember, Sully, when
  I promised to kill you last?\n\nSully: That’s right, Matrix. You did.\n\nMatrix:
  I lied. "
