  Happy New Year!
  The whole team is standing around on a roof. Walt is holding champagne. 
  *POP*
  Walt: A toast!
  | Walt: To a team who can handle just about anything!
  | Xyzzy (remoting in, on a phone): To working from home!
  | Lain: To long life and short line lengths!
  | Miloslav: To failing fast while you can
  | Warbeard: And failing gracefully at 3AM
  | Cube-Drone: And to never hardcoding the year into anything! 
  | Everyone but Sparky: Cheers!
  | Sparky: shit.
