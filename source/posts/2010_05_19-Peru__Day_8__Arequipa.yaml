content: ! "Woke up and had our second shower of the trip (our first was in Miraflores
  on Day 2, and we had spent the interim camping, so you can imagine how badly we
  were starting to need a good shower) \n\nBetween the shower, the shave, and the
  clean, fresh clothes, I felt quite a bit like a new man.\n\nWe sacked up our laundry
  and took it downstairs to the laundry service, who promised to have it ready by
  8pm. \n\nThen, the continental breakfast - actually very well done, with juice,
  cereal, toast, buns, jam, eggs, cheese, ham, a variety of teas, and coffee.  Looking
  forward to more of the same tomorrow, although our schedule will be more demanding
  and we may not have as much time to sit around for a relaxed breakfast. \n\nThen
  a group of us hit the town, deciding to explore.  We started by visiting the Plaza
  De Armas (remember when I said that most Spanish-inspired cities had one?) - this
  one more impressive and beautiful, even, than the one in Lima.  We then did a great
  big circular walk, crossing a couple of bridges and seeing what appeared to me to
  be an entirely pointless chunk of city. \n\nThen, everybody decided that it was
  time to sit down and have a coffee, back at the Plaza de Armas.\n\nMe, Kristen,
  and Lars thought that this was silly - we had just walked around the city, missing
  all of the major landmarks, almost immediately after enjoying free coffee with breakfast,
  and it was now time to sit for a solid hour or so trying to get a cup at a local
  cafe? \n\nAt this point, we've all started to become a bit accustomed to the Latin
  American Rules of Dining, which clearly state that no casual meal should take less
  than an hour, and no full meal less than two.\n\nOur tiny band headed for the Convent
  of Santa Catalina, a huge and impressive nunnery that was closed to the public until
  the 1970's.  Similarly to the Monastery of San Francisco, there is a small, active
  sect working within the walls, in a private area, not accessible to the public.
  \ The Convent, however, was much larger than the Monastery, a miniature city within
  the walls, with streets and buildings, all of them once part of a totally private
  community.  And this \"Jesus\" fellow kept popping up in there, too.  He's a popular
  guy in Peru.  Maybe he was a radio DJ or something?  He seems too skinny for that,
  though.\n\nAfterwards, we wandered to a museum, one offering a look at another mummy
  - this one a 400-year-old Inca girl, around 12-years old, who had been sacrificed,
  left near a live volcano, and preserved by a rare process by which environmental
  factors can produce mummification.\n\nThe girl and her belongings gave us a look
  into the Inca religion and some of their day-to-day life, but it was ... grim, and
  I was glad to get going.\n\nWe stopped for lunch at a store that seemed brimming
  with locals, the \"Mammut\" - the logo for which is a sandwich with a trunk, like
  an elephant.. or a mammoth, I suppose.  The sandwiches were cheap, and large, as
  were the beverages - I had a quite-large chicken, cheese, and bacon sandwich with
  garlic mayonnaise and a coke for 10 soles (Around $4 USD )\n\nWe wandered back towards
  the hotel, having seen just about everything 'touristy' in Arequipa - stopping at
  a local souvenir store to buy an Alpaca wool sweater and hat.  Honestly, a wool
  sweater for 30 soles? I'm afraid that it's probably of poor quality, but we'll find
  out later.  I've heard that the best price-to-quality ratio, wool-wise, can be found
  in Puno.  I was hoping to find a nice blanket for my eventual new apartment. \n\nHotel.
  I started trying to upload some of my pictures to Flickr (still working on that,
  many hours later, it's a big process) write some long and detailed day summaries,
  and generally loaf about.  The pictures are going to need a lot of tender love and
  care, anyways - I've apparently taken about 450 so far.\n\nWe tried dinner at the
  little restaurant in the hotel.  It was terrible.  My hamburger arrived without
  a bun, pink on the inside, and with green-beans. Yegh.  Complete dinner failure.
  \ If I had a better command of Spanish, I'd have complained, but instead I just
  smiled and paid for it. \n\nNow it's late - 11:00 - and we have to wake up at 6:30
  to get an early start on tomorrow - Chivay and the Colca Canyon. \n\nOh, and, thanks
  to numerous excuses ('too much laundry') our laundry still isn't done, nor is it
  apparently even in the building.  In the morning, if there is not clean clothing,
  I cam going to have to make it quite clear that I would rather have dirty pants
  than no pants.  We need to pack up our gear, get our laundry, have breakfast, and
  load up the truck for departure at 8:00... so it's going to be a busy morning, especially
  if there are more problems with the laundry.\n\nThere may be internet in Chivay.
  \ Or not.  We'll see. "
