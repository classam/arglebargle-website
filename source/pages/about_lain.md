Lain
====
A *front-end developer and designer*. Lain is a coder and artist. 
She likes [markers](http://cube-drone.com/2014_10_24-92_Marker_Party.html), 
and has a [framed unicorn t-shirt](http://cube-drone.com/2012_05_31-Cube_Drone_9__Sleuthing.html) 
at her desk. 
Lain is an avid privacy advocate, even 
if she did relent and give the [Google Glass a try](http://cube-drone.com/2014_01_20-Cube_Drone_69_Technophiliac.html). 
She wears a heavy jacket
to work, even on hot days, for reasons that she'd rather not discuss with
you. The office is air-conditioned anyways. 

Lain is opinionated about food options in the city. She's tried every food-truck
in Vancouver and keeps an up-to-date ranking of them on her blog.
