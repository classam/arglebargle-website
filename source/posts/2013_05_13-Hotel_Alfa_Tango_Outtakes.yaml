  <Curtis> I need to write a comic! Quickly, make a witty, insightful observation about the technology industry that I can steal and pass off as my own! 
  <Angelina> Well 
  <Angelina> It's not about the tech industry 
  <Angelina> I'm at a hotel right now 
  <Angelina> by myself 
  <Angelina> and I opened the drawer beside the bed 
  <Angelina> because whenever I go into a hotel room, for whatever reason I just need to open ALL the drawers 
  <Curtis> Teeny tiny dead prostitute? 
  <Angelina> discover ALL the amenities 
  <Angelina> no 
  <Angelina> There was a bible 
  <Curtis> Bible stuffed with another bible? 
  <Angelina> the gideon one 
  <Curtis> "Doubible" 
  <Angelina> red cover, gold inlay 
  <Angelina> and... 
  <Angelina> a single, unopened glowstick. 
  <Angelina> so I mean. 
  <Angelina> Why is it there? 
  <Angelina> Christian rave sex party? 
  <Curtis> "This has been the single worst rave" 
  <Angelina> I MEAN COME ON ROGUE GLOWSTICK WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING THERE 
  <Angelina> I told Jacky about it earlier 
  <Curtis> Well, I'm pretty sure the bible is always there 
  <Angelina> and she's convinced me to find a dollar store and leave a similarly ridiculous item in another drawer before leaving 
  <Curtis> That doesn't sound like a hard sell 
  <Angelina> that's all I got for you I'm afraid 
  <Curtis> I always wonder why they leave bibles in hotel rooms 
  <Angelina> about to go to bed 
  <Angelina> and now I'll wonder about this glowstick 
  <Angelina> like 
  <Angelina> if I take it home 
  <Angelina> will it appear on my bill? 
  <Angelina> WILL THERE BE A GLOW STICK CHARGE? 
  <Angelina> IS THIS A STANDARD AMENITY 
  <Angelina> i read the little book by the phone 
  <Angelina> it wasn't listed as a mini-bar item 
  <Curtis> GLOW STICK: $12 
  <Angelina> if I bring it to the desk, will I look ridiculous? 
  <Angelina> "Who is this girl.. why did she bring us a glow stick?" 
  <Angelina> "No ma'am, we don't put glow sticks in our hotel rooms." 
  <Curtis> I worked at a hotel front desk for a while 
  <Curtis> If someone said they found a glow-stick in a drawer, I'd .. 
  <Curtis> probably talk to management (cleaning staff never listened to me) and tell them to tell the cleaning staff to make sure to check the drawers for detritus during the cleanings 
  <Curtis> ... 
  <Curtis> I HAVE ACTIVELY SUCKED ALL OF THE FUN OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION. YOU MAY NOW SLEEP.
