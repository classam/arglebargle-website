  So, if you've been following me on RSS, you may have noticed that my site is currently going through a little bit of
  crazy go-nuts wackytown times. The reason? I've switched away from my old pal, Wordpress, and am now using a blog engine
  entirely of my own design.

  No, I have not gone crazy. 

  It's a static website compiler. It takes, as an argument, a folder full of .yaml files, and produces, as output, an entire
  website. The [compiler](https://github.com/classam/busbus), 
  the [theme](https://github.com/classam/busbus_theme), 
  and the [content itself](https://github.com/classam/Blog) all occupy separate git repositiories, and if I change anything 
  (and push it to git), it will re-generate my website using a git hook.

  But why? 

  Well, recently, Wordpress has been giving me a lot of trouble.  The site's been hacked, the comment system is uninspiring, 
  and honestly, I just wanted to build something.  I like building things. 

  The entirely static website output is fast. Very fast. There is almost zero server overhead to doling out flat files.
  You can, should you so choose, page through my entire website, pretty quickly.  Page load times are in the 100 millisecond range.

  Of course, Wordpress handles that same problem well with the wp_cache plugin. And I'll bloat that 100 milliseconds up with
  unnecessary javascript glitter as soon as I can. But still! 

  Okay, the much bigger difference? I wrote it myself. And the codebase is quite small. Yes. Nigh-infinite customization is at 
  my fingers. If I want to write blog posts in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)? 
  Sure. Let's say, I want to write a script that queues up a blog post for me in my favourite text editor. 
  Done. Want to drop a chunk of content from my favourite IRC channel on to my
  blog without extensively hand-formatting it first? I could write a script for that, no problem. Heck, the whole system is 
  designed from the ground up to be trivially easy to poke around in. 

  There are still features to add. Things like:
  - A website style that doesn't look like I found it at the bottom of a box of crackerjacks. 
  - DISQUS comments. 
  - Unnecessary but shiny javascript features! (See also: DISQUS comments.)

  And if you notice any unusual problems or huge errors, you should.. alert me to that fact. Perhaps using the comment system
  that I haven't implemented yet.
