content: ! "So, I work at <a href=\"http://classam.deviantart.com/\">deviantArt</a>
  now, instead of<a href=\"http://telus.com/\"> that thing that I used to do</a>.
  \n\nIt's... nice. I feel like a developer again.  I'm no longer spending 50% of
  my week in meetings with several groups of stakeholders, each one arguing about
  the best design for a feature for a nebulously defined 'user' thousands of kilometers
  away, while I slowly drift to sleep.  No more Oracle stack, no more long-drawn-out-software-design-process
  full of milestones and roadblocks and approval from 83 different competing groups.
  \ I'm working on a huge codebase. Fixing bugs.  Using a <a href=\"http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/vimcheat.html\">man's
  man's editor</a>.  I'm surrounded by developers who are diverse, and driven, and
  smart. They have to be driven and smart - apparently, the team has a pretty high
  attrition rate for new developers (<a href=\"http://randomduck.deviantart.com/\">$randomduck</a>
  estimated 33% when I asked him) .  I express concern thanks to my <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&q=I%27m+24+years+old&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1440&bih=673\">comparative
  youth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/images?um=1&hl=en&biw=1440&bih=673&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=I+started+programming+in+2004&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=\">inexperience</a>
  - but if it turns out that I suck, I can always go back to my <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/images?um=1&hl=en&biw=1440&bih=673&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=tie&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=\">soul-crushing
  corporate thing</a>. \n\nI'm still pretty new to the whole site - I don't even know
  what half of the features of dA <em>are</em>, let alone how to fix them if they
  break.  But I fixed a bug on my first day, and three more over the course of the
  week... so I guess I'm doing okay for now. I've learned a lot this week, and I have
  a lot more to learn, this week, and next week, and the week after. (<em>Then I'm
  done. No more learning for me. </em>) It helps that the rest of the development
  team is nigh-constantly both available and helpful.\n\nProtip:<a href=\"http://betterthangrep.com/\">
  ack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vectorsite.net/tsawk.html\">awk</a> are different
  tools. If you confuse the two, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/classam/status/55903300700213249\">you
  will feel like an idiot</a>. \n\nOh, and it's a telecommuting job.  That may be
  the sweetest plum of all.  My apartment has a better technology setup, a more well-stocked
  kitchen, and a quieter, more comfortable working environment than any cubicle. I'll
  miss my co-workers - not the stuffed suits, mind you, but the interesting people
  who made the Telus BTLDP worthwhile. \n"
