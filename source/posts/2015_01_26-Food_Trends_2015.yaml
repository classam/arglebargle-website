  In this [Details](http://www.details.com/blogs/daily-details/2015/01/chefs-predict-food-trends.html?mbid=social_facebook) article, chefs have
  predicted a set of new food trends in 2015. 

  Here are *my* predictions: 
  * Even more ridiculous things piled on top of poutine. You thought SHORT RIB was silly? wait until you see POUTINE AVEC AN ENTIRE FRIGGING COUNTRY HAM.
  * Micro-distillery will continue to prove that "it's not moonshine if you have an art degree".
  * Top brunch scientists will do their best to find a four-dimensional superposition of eggs benedict that manages to include even more rich ingredients. Avocado will be stretched to its very limits. Somebody will propose proscuitto, only to be slapped by a grizzled old man with a deep scar across one eye. One man will prepare a tiny, adorable eggs benedict with quail eggs, and nobody will care.
  * There will be a literal, actual wheat revolution. Farmers have had it too hard for too long.
  * Chefs, having realized that they can get away with charging $18 for a handful of deli meats handsomely arranged on a plank, will continue to offer charcuterie.
  * Hard liquor and soup: together at last? Will 2015 be the year?
  * Ramen will go mainstream for like 6 months. Then everybody will realize that Pho is a way better noodle soup, and what were they even thinking?
