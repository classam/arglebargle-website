secret-text: "To try and recover some of their market share, Rolex collaborated with Jabra to make a watch for flashy assholes."
alt-text: |
  Wearables from other companies:
  | The Oracle watch weighs over 14 Kg and requires around-the-clock
  maintenance; it still sells well to large companies because it
  has the most features.
  | Microsoft's watch will be a commercial flop, but millions of
  desktop users will briefly be flustered by Windows 11 defaulting
  to "Watch mode".
  | Blackberry, hoping to deliver a compelling experience to
  the business market, accidentally reinvented the pager.
