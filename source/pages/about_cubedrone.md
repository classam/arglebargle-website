Cube Drone 
==========
The titular character, Cube Drone is an ex-Java programmer working for a 
trendy startup company in Vancouver. 

Cube Drone predates the "Cube Drone" comic strip - I've been drawing him
since I worked at TELUS, although he shaved his
[terrible moustache](http://cube-drone.com/2011_01_08-Dont_Cry_Cube_Drone.html)
when he left the giant telecom and started a strip of his own.  

Cube Drone is the *developer*. Not the team lead, or the senior developer, 
the front-end developer, the dev/ops, or the back-end guy, he's just a 
vanilla developer.

Canonically, [Cube Drone is the one responsible for the Cube Drone animated shorts](http://cube-drone.com/2014_03_19-Cube_Drone_77_A_Problem_In_My_Shorts.html), 
although they're hosted on my [youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/IkoIkoComic/videos).

Cube Drone is suspicious of change, a cynic, a worrier, the sort who's more
concerned with his own lunch than his company's goals.
