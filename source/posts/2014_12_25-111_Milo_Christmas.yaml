  Cube Drone: Can I get a couple of days off around Christmas?
  | Walt: Sure. Truth be told, this place is a total ghost town on the 24th. Except for Milo. God knows what he gets up to.
  | Christmas Eve: Milo is sitting in his office, with a tiny tree and
  lights strung up. 
  Milo: Finally, peace and quiet. I'm gonna get so much work done.
