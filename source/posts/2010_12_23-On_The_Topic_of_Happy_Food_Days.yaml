  articles expound endlessly on a variety of topics completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of putting things in
  my food-hole, have just had <em>the best food day</em>.\n\nThis morning? Eggs and
  bacon. Normally I start my day with no breakfast at all, and the step up from 'no
  breakfast' to 'bacon and eggs' was awesome. \n\nThis afternoon? Me and some co-workers
  went to the <a href=\"http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/chinamil_07_09/chinamil8.jpg\">Crystal
  Mall</a> to buy Clive a <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/gz8c1wnj\">giant Hello Kitty</a>.
  Clive was embarrassed to walk around with a giant Hello Kitty - which is strange,
  because despite all of our mocking, it just made him twice as irresistible to the
  ladies. \n\nI've never ventured into the Crystal Mall before, because I don't speak
  Chinese, and because they had nothing of interest to me.  Until we walked through
  the food court.  Hey, look, dumpling vendor!  \n\nI finally got a chance to try
  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Long_Bao\">Xiao Long Bao</a>: Soup Dumplings.
  They were exactly as delicious as I thought that they would be. I made the mistake
  of explaining to Brandi what the '<a href=\"http://steamykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/broth-gelatin.jpg\">soup</a>'
  was inside Xiao Long Bao. \n\nAlso? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Dan_Noodles\">Dan
  Dan Noodles</a>.  As it turns out, Sichuan Pepper adds a crazy delicious ... somethinginess
  ... to food. Mouth numbingly good.  \n\nThen, for dinner, I reheated a lamb-and-beef
  shepherd's pie that I prepped earlier.  All in all, today has been delicious. \n"
