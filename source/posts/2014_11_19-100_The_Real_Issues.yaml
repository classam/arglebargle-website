  First frame: (Cube Drone is giving a presentation) 
   | Cube Drone: Before I begin my talk, I'd like to draw some attention to the gentleman with the red hat in the third row, who was right in front of me at lunch.
   | Second frame: (On the presentation screen is a picture of a man in a red hat, holding a shrimp with some tongs.)
   | Cube Drone: Pictured here, carefully, with surgical precision, taking every last shrimp from the shrimp and noodle tray. 
   | Third frame: (Cube drone is visibly angry)
   | Cube Drone: You violated a social contract and left naught but a bereft, shrimpless mass of noodles in your wake. For shame.
