  First frame: Cube Drone, to Sparky: Sparky, you've never been to Revolver? Trendy coffee-shop in Vancouver?
  | Second frame: It's a magical place where you pay an exorbitant fee to have a coffee slowly poured for you.
  | Third frame: And all this in a cafe so small, you'll have to fight for space while they gently caress your coffee to life.
