   What drives enjoyment? What drives us?

   This is a question whose answer has wide-spread utility. I'm no renaissance
   man, but I've poked around in a few different fields, and it's come up 
   at TELUS (when the question was about managing human beings in the workplace),
   it's come up as a question of board game and video game theory (when the 
   question was about how to craft an enjoyable experience), it comes up as a 
   facet of artificial intelligence (where determining what to motivate an
   optimization algorithm with is a great big deal), and it even provides some
   insight into my own depression. 

   We can start by saying that humans are not simple risk-reward optimization
   machines. In economics, [Rational choice theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory) 
   models human systems by assuming that humans are, at least on the aggregate,
   rational machines that act to optimize certain external variables. Because
   money is a convenient analogue for numerous human needs - power, food,
   social status - we can predict human behavior to a limited extent by 
   simply assuming that every human is optimizing to try to maximize 
   their fortune at any given time.

   In aggregate, rational choice and simple optimization can produce useful
   models of human behavior - but on the level of individual humans, it 
   tends to fall disastrously short. More reward does not correspond to 
   more motivation. In artificial intelligence, constructing intelligences
   that optimize for a single well-chosen parameter can be used to simulate
   intelligences, but these intelligences only fare well in simple games
   and seem peculiar and alien when we observe their behavior. 

   In a 'theory of fun' sense, the single-variable optimization way of 
   looking at things gives way to 'scoreboard' play. You play to try to 
   get the highest score, or the fastest time. Most gamers would concede 
   that a scoreboard alone is not enough to drive a fun gameplay experience
   - even though it can add to it. 

   * _Principal Skinner_:  Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA!
   * _Bart_: You're making me lick envelopes?
   * _Skinner_: Oh, licking envelopes can be fun!  All you have to do is make a game of it.
   * _Bart_: What kind of game?
   * _Skinner_ : Well, for example, you could see how many you could lick in an hour,
     then try to break that record.
   * _Bart_: Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
   * _Skinner_: Yes, well... Get started.

   From a more psychological perspective, there's Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs,
   [Attachment Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory), 
   [Terror Management Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management)...
   but these theories tend to be staggeringly complicated and have 
   limited predictive power. 
   
   You may be familiar with the RSA Animate epsiode, 
   [Drive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)", where they discuss
   motivation at some length, simplifying it into three things that we 
   tend to optimize for - Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.
   
   * _Autonomy_ - Do you have some level of control over what is happening?
     Are you self-directed? 
   * _Mastery_ - If you've completely mastered something, it's boring. 
     If something is completely out of your control, it's frustrating. 
     But developing mastery is enjoyable. 
   * _Purpose_ - Do your actions serve some sort of larger goal? 

   And the thing that brought me to write this article was reading about
   Yahzee's [threefold theory of fun in video games](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/9276-Context-Challenge-and-Gratification ).
   If you look closely at his "Context", "Challenge" and "Gratification" 
   triad, it looks very similar to the Purpose, Mastery, and Autonomy of the
   Drive presentation. Context is thinly veiled Purpose - unifying gameplay
   elements by providing a larger narrative purpose that you serve by playing.
   Challenge is a clear stand-in for Mastery. And, oddly enough, Gratification,
   as Yahzee describes it, is accomplished by just dicking around in an
   entertaining system - blasting around in Grand Theft Auto and ramping cool
   jumps as you find them. It's not quite Autonomy, but it's close. 

   It would seem that an arbitrary system is most enjoyable when you can 
   interact meaningfully with it, when there's a smooth curve of understanding,
   and when it has a cohesive purpose.

   Other human propensities seem to fit nicely into this model. Relationships
   with other humans, cooking tasty meals, gardening, video games, reading,
   all of these things that we enjoy offer us autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

   If we start building systems that seek out autonomy and mastery, we see
   behaviors that seem to more closely approach real intelligence. 
   In [this video](http://archive.org/details/Redwood_Center_2013_01_29_Goren_Gordon),
   Goren Gordon presents a great deal of work towards developing a system 
   that displays curiosity - by incentivizing 'control over environment' as
   an optimization goal. 

   Anyhow, that brings me to the problem of my current depression.

   Boo, hiss! This is where I go off of the rails and stop making any kind
   of sense, so if you're just reading for personal edification, 
   stop here. Everything past this point is self-indulgent bullshit of 
   the sort that I've been posting for days. 

   I've spent the last, say, 10 years of my life developing my autonomy and
   mastery of the various systems that I require to maintain that autonomy.
   I can work, cook, pay taxes, drive, important stuff of that kind. Where
   I seem to have fallen short is purpose. 

   I had a purpose. Numerous purposes, really - I've always wanted to be 
   a writer, an artist, and a coder. I've always wanted good relationships
   and fun games to play with the people in my life, good sex and good food.
   That's a pretty reliable set of things to work on, and they've always
   managed to bring me happiness. All of these sub-systems offer autonomy, 
   mastery, and purpose of their own. 

   Gathering karma on reddit, or likes on Facebook, or building a particularly
   pretty Minecraft world - these things can all seem completely meaningless
   to people who are not invested in the system.
   
   There are numerous articles on the internet where people abandon, say, 
   social media, realizing that while the system is enjoyable, in the long
   run it doesn't advance any of their personal goals. This system is a 
   [waste of time](http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130427/NEWS02/130429239). 

   Essentially, while Autonomy and Mastery are attractive, without a compelling
   Purpose a system can lose its entertainment value pretty quickly.

   [Purpose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise), though, as far as I can 
   tell, is completely relative. One person may find purpose in learning many 
   langages, where another may find purpose in building many relationships.

   The understanding, though, that purpose is completely relative, removes
   purpose from everything. Money, friends, career, influence, personal 
   development, health, these things are no more meaningful than reddit karma.
   Evaluating my purposes, I find them as ultimately meaningless as any other
   purpose. 

   The biggest complicating factor is death. The reason that I pursue my 
   hobbies, rather than just lying on the couch in a perpetual state of
   despair, is because they offer the promise of long-term happiness. 

   It's a bit of a catch-22 - a positive one, mind you - my present 
   happiness exists because I pursue future happiness. All of my motivation
   and drive revolves around trying to create future opportunities for 
   happiness. 

   The problem of death creates a snag, though. When I die, the universe
   ceases to exist. Oh, I'm sure in a logical sense that it will happily 
   go on without me - but that's small solace, because once I am gone, it 
   doesn't really matter to me whether or not a universe exists at all. 
   
   Which means that my universe is this self-contained period between
   that first thought a long time ago, and that time, say, 30-60 years 
   hence when one of my more important parts stops working. 
   Maybe the advancing tide of technology can add a few years - 
   although upon closer inspection, it doesn't seem too likely -
   but even if that number gets bigger, some kind of end is still inevitable. 

   I can't imagine I would mind, much, being dead - I mean, there
   won't be a me to mind. Which is really the concern, there. Why bother
   trying to create future opportunities for happiness if there is no future?
   If the end-state doesn't change, why do anything at all? Why prolong it, 
   even? I am a [tiny, temporary](http://hereistoday.com/) soap-bubble of consciousness, throwing cards 
   in a hat and waiting patiently for everything to come to an end. 
   In that sense, happiness itself is just as meaningless as anything else - 
   I'm just playing a little game that's been programmed into my head while I 
   wait to die. 

   So much of life seems to be intended just to distract us from this. 
   If you eat healthy and exercise, you'll live longer! Buy this, it will
   make you happy! Play this game, watch this television show, it will 
   distract you! You should do everything on your bucket list before you go! 
   Build a legacy, you'll live on through your work! 
   Don't think too hard about it, there's so much to do! 

   It's this thought that drains the purpose, autonomy, and mastery from
   everything that I do. And I've been thinking it, constantly, non-stop, 
   for the past two months. Constant war-drums of "YOU'RE GOING TO DIE" and
   "IT'S ALL MEANINGLESS" pounding in my head whenever I stop to think,
   whenever I do anything that's not mind-occupying distraction.

   Of course, I could just throw myself 100% into mind-occupying distraction,
   but that's a kind of death, too, isn't it? 

   It doesn't really seem to matter anyways. 

   Ergo, depression. Anxiety, fear, and sadness, on repeat, interrupted 
   by short bursts of feeling like myself.
