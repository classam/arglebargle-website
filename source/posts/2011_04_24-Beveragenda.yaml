content: ! "So, a brief sojourn to the United States of America leaves me now equipped
  with some new things. \n\nHere are some of the <em>office supplies</em> I came back
  with: \n\n<ul>\n<li> A coffee grinder. </li>\n<li> A very, very small coffee machine.
  (2 cups, bitches! ) </li>\n<li> An even smaller coffee machine: (1 cup. It's basically
  a funnel that sits on top of a mug. ) </li> \n<li> A cast-iron teapot. </li> \n<li>
  2.5 lbs of assorted looseleaf black teas. (Irish Breakfast, Borengajuli Assam, and
  an extremely dark African tea. ) </li>\n<li> A jigger/pony. </li>\n<li> 1L of Grey
  Goose vodka. </li> \n<li> A spatula, with which to spatul. </li>\n</ul> \n\nYes.
  Awesome. BEVERAGE. "
