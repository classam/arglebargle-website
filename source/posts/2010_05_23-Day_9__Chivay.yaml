  was finally ready at 6 in the morning, which was a relief. \n\nTruck truck truck
  truck truck truck.  Driving.  Lots of driving.\n\nLet us have a few words on the
  topic of altitude sickness.  Altitude is horrible.  Higher than 10,000 feet - and
  we will be higher than 10,000 feet for the remainder of our trip - there's just
  not enough air.  My headache started - I'm calling it 'my headache' because I'm
  writing this about 4 days later and said headache has not yet subsided.  Just walking
  around, or walking up steps, anything, takes it right out of us - the spirit is
  willing but the lungs can't take in enough air. Deep wheezing. \n\nThe altitude
  also causes dehydration.  The blood stream reacts to the lower amount of oxygen
  by trying to press more red blood cells into less space, making less room for water.
  \ We all drank spectacular amounts of liquid and had a 'pee stop' every half an
  hour or so. \n\nThe truck took a brief stop at a ... well, 'stop', a building surrounded
  by tourist buses, shops and stalls.  Inside the building? Snacks and coca tea.  The
  mild analgesic properties of coca tea were welcome, considering how sore the altitude
  was making us. \n\nWe stopped at Chivay, all of us exhausted and beaten just by
  the sudden sharp increase in altitude.  For lunch, a little all-you-can-eat restaurant.
  \ Lots of miscellaneous Peruvian food - spinach nuggety things, extraordinarily
  hot peppers stuffed with chili, soups, stews, that sort of thing. \n\nWe went to
  our hotel room.  I had a brief nap. \n\nAfter-nap, a group of us went to the nearby
  hot springs for a soak.  While the mountain air was very chilly, the water was hot
  and comfortable.  Most of us who soaked felt quite a bit better, if a tad chilly.\n\nWe
  came back to the hotel, and almost immedately conked out. We were very tired.\n\nKristen
  had trouble breathing. She didn't sleep well. For that reason, I didn't sleep well. "
