  Islands.\n\nWe took bicycle-powered rickshaws to the harbor.  They're very cheap,
  and fun, if a bit slow.  Some of them are equipped with loud radios.  The rickshaw
  nearest to us was playing \"Thriller\" when we arrived at the harbor.\n\nWe boarded
  a standard boat - none of this 'reeds and mud' for us, this was a real boat, with
  two levels and seats. \n\nLake Titicaca is huge.  Enormous.  The name 'Titicaca'
  means 'gray puma' in Aymara, the local native language.\n\nThe Uros Floating Islands
  are man-made islands, made entirely out of reeds.  Reeds upon reeds upon reeds.
  The Uros, as a people, have lived on these islands as fishermen for a very long
  time, trading excess fish for grains with local farmers.  Now they live on the islands
  as combination fishermen/tourist attraction.\n\nWe sat in a circle on the island
  while our guide told us what she could about how the island was constructed and
  how the Uros culture operated.\n\nWe were briefly distracted - the island had a
  pet kitten, who was causing trouble by chasing a few young chickens around.  The
  kitten was clearly still getting the hang of the uneven footing on the reed island.\n\nOur
  island had maybe 13 families on it.  We were each invited into huts by islanders.
  \ The islander I followed spoke fluent English, albeit very quietly.  He had a university
  degree in tourism, and when his wife finished high school, she would study nursing.
  \ They had a small child and a solar powered television.  \n\nKristen decided to
  support the local economy by using some of my money to purchase some expensive hand-made
  crafts.  Seriously, I don't know what we're going to do with all of this hand-made
  pottery and knit wool when we get home.  (Thanks to my intimate relationship with
  the ATM machines, I've been providing most of the scratch for this trip so far.)
  \n\nWe took a short trip on a reed boat, a short trip that took a very long time.
  \ The islanders have since converted to the much faster, much safer metal boats
  for fishing and chores, but they keep the reed boats around for tourists.\n\nAfter
  the reed boat trip, we took a motorboat back to Puno.  We had a slow lunch of fresh
  trout.  Well, the lunch wasn't that slow by South American standards, but my impatience
  with the speed of meals here is getting worse as I go along.  The culture is different
  and meals out are very relaxed and <em>very</em> slow.\n\nIt was time to bus from
  Peru to Bolivia. \n\nBus bus bus. \n\nAt the Bolivian border, I exchanged my Nueva
  Soles to Bolivianos.  Bolivianos are worth even less than Soles - about 7 Bolivianos
  to the dollar, as opposed to around 3 Soles to the dollar.  My small amount of remaining
  Soles tripled into a much more significant amount of Bolivianos.\n\nWhile Peru feels
  open, and democratic, and poor, Bolivia still has that lingering Millitary Junta
  feel to it, at least at borders and checkpoints.  Men who look like <a href=\"http://www.amoeba.com/dynamic-images/blog/Charles/quantum-solace-joaquin-cosio-medrano.jpg\">General
  Medrano from the movie 'Quantum of Solace'</a> stand at checkpoints in military
  uniforms.  Palms must be greased to move through the country at any pace- fortunately,
  our Spanish-speaking tour guide knows his way around the whole process pretty well
  by now, and quietly and privately expedites the illicit deals.\n\nWe had our documents
  stamped and moved on to the city of Copacabana.  Honestly, based on the name (and
  the fame of the name) I was expecting an expensive-but-posh resort town on the beaches
  of Lake Titicaca.  What we ended up finding was Yet Another Little South American
  Town.  No hot showers here, either. "
