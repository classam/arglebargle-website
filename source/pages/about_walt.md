Walt Rock
=========
Every team needs a *project manager*. Walt is that project manager. 
He's the [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/),
the man in touch with both the needs of his engineering team and the needs of
the [C*-level executives](http://cube-drone.com/2014_07_08-Cube_Drone_82_Corporatespeak.html) 
above him - at the expense of being treated with a certain 
amount of suspicion by both. 

Don't be fooled, though - Walt's an experienced programmer as well - 
he just doesn't
get as many opportunities to code as he used to.

Walt is [endlessly optimistic](http://cube-drone.com/2015_01_06-114_Office_Space.html).
He's not just a glass half full type, he's the sort
of guy who would be delighted by an empty glass - hey, free glass, right?
